        "title": "How to Work 40 Hours in 16.7",
        "description": "I used to work a lot — 60, 80, or even 100 hours a week. I let my work be a big part of how I defined myself. I wore those insane hours like a badge of honor…I loved telling people how “busy” I was…and how much I “had to do”.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nLooking back, I realize I used my work to try and fill a void in myself. The problem was that this void was like a black hole. No matter how many hours I worked, it never seemed to fill it up. If anything, it made me feel worse.\n\nOne day I’d had enough. Truth be told, I’d had way more than enough. I stopped and reevaluated my life, trying to figure out what was important to me, and what wasn’t. I realized that while work was important, because I want to feel productive, it was just one important thing…and not the most important one at that. What’s more, I realized that working on things I didn’t really like was detrimental to my well-being.\n\nSo I decided I had to make a big change…\n\nSearching for the Way\n\nSince my work is important to me, I had to figure out how to work smarter, not harder. I had to optimize my work process, doing more in less time.\n\nOf course, I also had to find work I enjoyed, that fulfilled me, rather than work that drained me. By doing this, I have more time to improve myself, be with friends and family, and truly be healthy on all levels — mind, body, and soul.\n\nI love to read. I especially love to read things that help me improve myself. The change I embarked on gave me the perfect excuse to go on a reading binge! I read every book I could find on the subject of working smarter. I read a ton of blog posts on the same topic. I talked to people.\n\nThen, I took the things that made the most sense to me, and implemented them. Some were complete disasters. Some worked partially, but clearly weren’t for me.\n\nI noticed that several different solutions each had a piece of the puzzle. I took those parts that worked for me, and combined them into my own system. Slowly but surely, I developed a formula that would forever change how I work.\nEnter the Pomodoro\n\nOver the years I‘d heard about a time management system called the Pomodoro Technique. It seemed too simplistic, but as they say, the simplest things often work best.\n\nI read the 2006 paper written by its creator, Francesco Cirilio, which explained the technique and as importantly, the psychology behind it. This revolutionary time management system is deceptively simple to learn, but life-changing when applied correctly. The Pomodoro Technique can be broken down into the following four basic principles.\n\n1. Work with time, not against it: Many of us live as if time is our enemy. We race the clock to finish assignments and meet deadlines. The Pomodoro Technique teaches us to work with time, instead of struggling against it.\n\n2. Eliminate burnout: Taking short, scheduled breaks while working eliminates the “running on fumes” feeling you get when you push yourself too hard. It’s impossible to overwork when you stick to the system.\n\n3. Manage distractions: Phone calls, emails, Facebook messages, or suddenly realizing you need to change the oil in your car — distractions constantly bombard us. Usually, these distractions can wait. The Pomodoro Technique helps you log your distractions, and prioritize them for later.\n\n4. Create a better work/life balance: Most of us are far too intimately acquainted with the guilt that comes from procrastination. If we haven’t had a productive day, we can’t seem to enjoy our free time. As a Pomodoro Master, you create an effective timetable and achieve your high-priority tasks, so you truly enjoy your time off.\n\n“All this is great,” you may think, “but what do I actually do?”\nIt’s Simple:\n\n1) Choose a task;\n\n2) Set a timer for 25 minutes;\n\n3) Work on your task until the timer rings, then put a checkmark on a tracker;\n\n4) Take a five minute break (you just completed your first Pomodoro!); then\n\n5) Repeat steps 1–4 three more times, followed by a 15 minute break.\nSimple, But…\n\nNow, you’re probably thinking “Twenty five minutes of work? That’s nothing! This is gonna be easy!” Not so fast… That’s 25 minutes of steady, focused work on ONE task. No multitasking. No emails. No phone calls. No checking Facebook. Nothing! No distractions allowed!\n\nFor me, this took some getting used to, and required some tools and hacks. Here’s what I used:\n\n1) A kitchen timer (or an app);\n\n2) Airplane mode (the most important function on any mobile phone!);\n\n3) A quiet place to work and/or a good pair of headphones or earplugs;\n\n4) Pen and paper (for those Pomodoro checkmarks);\n\n5) Five minutes each morning to plan out the day’s tasks; and\n\n6) 30 minutes at the end of each week to review the past week and plan for the next.\nFinding the Magic Combination\n\nLike most things in my life, I learned through experimentation, experiencing a lot of pain and frustration but ultimately growth.\n\nAt first, I thought I could do 16 Pomodoros each day, no problem. I was used to working so much, that less than seven hours of work seemed like a breeze. The first day I completed 12 Pomodoros. I got a ton done, but still felt like a failure because I fell short of my goal. I felt tired and miserable.\n\nOver the following days, I tried cutting back on my target number. When it worked, I got a ton of stuff done and felt amazingly productive. I knew I was onto something good. Other days, I did too little or too much, felt like crap and was convinced this was the dumbest system in the world.\n\nOne day, I just ignored the system altogether and went back to multitasking. I was unfocused, unproductive, and frustrated. I gritted my teeth and kept doing things my old way for a few more days. What I found was that I got things done, but my productivity simply couldn’t compare to when it all clicked with the Pomodoros.\n\nSanity returned. I began experimenting with smaller numbers of Pomodoros, starting with five per day, gradually working my way up to eight. My goal was eight Pomodoros each weekday, for a total of 40 per week.\n\nThis worked (sort of) but as they say, life happens. Some days I had so many meetings to attend, or my daughter had a recital at school which I didn’t want to miss, and I just couldn’t find fit in eight Pomodoros. It became clear that 40 was my magic weekly number, but I needed to be less rigid with how I approached my work-week.\n\nThe math was straightforward: 40 Pomodoros = 1,000 minutes of work (plus 350 minutes of breaks) each week. This averages out to about 16.7 hours of work each week. That’s it!\n\nHowever, when I had too much going on, or felt physically or mentally off, I couldn’t fit in eight Pomodoros. I’d fall behind, and next day I’d try to cram in 14, leaving me exhausted and not very happy with the quality of my work.\n\nI realized I had to step back and rethink my week, paying attention to my moods. To refocus on what was right for me. The Pomodoro Technique was great, but something was missing to make it really work for me.\nThe Psychology of Motivation\n\nIn a perfect world, I’d have eight high-value tasks identified at the start of each workday. I’d prioritize these, and knock them off one by one, from most important to least. I’d be equally enthusiastic and motivated about each one, wouldn’t be interrupted, and would finish my day’s work in less than three hours.\n\nSounds great, right? Unfortunately, “we live nowhere near perfect”.\n\nThe reality is that I’m a human being, living in a world full of other humans. I have emotions I don’t control, and I often get tired. Some tasks I simply don’t feel like doing, even though I know they’re important, and possibly urgent.\n\nTo make this work long-term, I had to face these things and learn to accept them, working with, rather than against them.\n\nMy energy level and attitude affect my work and output, so I had to stay present to how I was feeling, and master myself. Reading a useful blog post, I found questions like these especially helpful:\n\n    My physical energy — how healthy am I?\n    My emotional energy — how happy am I?\n    My mental energy — how well can I focus on something?\n    My spiritual energy — why am I doing this? What is my purpose?\n\nThese questions helped me take into account my mood and energy when prioritizing tasks. As a result, I no longer did anything just because I felt I had to.\n\nWhen my physical energy was low, I’d work on my health and wellness. When my emotional energy was low, I’d find something that made me happy, like spending time with my wife and daughter.\nA Seven-Day Workweek\n\nRemember where I started all this — working crazy hours, evenings, and weekends?\n\nWhen I decided to change, I swore to myself I’d never work on weekends, holidays, vacations, or even after 5 PM. Great, right? Well, I’m happy to report I’ve broken all of these promises, and that’s actually a good thing.\n\nOn those days when I couldn’t finish eight Pomodoros by 5 PM, I’d feel stressed. I’d feel like a failure. Suddenly I realized my view of the work week was too limiting. Why did I make those commitments to myself, limiting when I could work? I did it because I was coming from an unfulfilling work life, working too many hours, and for the wrong reasons.\n\nI transitioned from just working…to working on things that fulfilled me. What’s more, I gave myself the freedom to do non-work stuff, such as attending my daughter’s recital during what most people consider work hours. This made it easy to shift my mindset about when I could or couldn’t work.\n\nThe final piece to my puzzle was moving from a five-day work-week, where I had to stop by 5 PM, to a seven-day work-week, where I could work when it suited me. This took me from 40–45 hours available to get my 40 Pomodoros in, to having 168 hours each week. Since I only need 16.7 hours net, that means I only work 10% of my time. What a difference!\nWhat?! I’m Supposed to Do Everything in Just 16.7 Hours a Week?!\n\nYou’re probably thinking, “I work more than that in two days and you’re trying to tell me that’s all I need to work in an entire week?”\n\nYES! That’s exactly what I’m telling you. And NO, you’ll probably still ‘work’ more than 16.7 hours a week. I ‘work’ 35–40 hours a week, but I spend at least 20–25 of those hours on calls, meetings, networking on- and offline, and other less-focused tasks. These are important, but I don’t count them as work time.\n\nI truly work 16.7 hours each week, and I get about five times more done in those few hours than in the other 25 hours.\n\nThere’s no avoiding it. Life happens. As long as humans are involved, and especially if you live in modern society with its 24/7 connectedness, it’s next to impossible to have a perfect working environment. However, you can work smarter without having to work harder.\n\nAre you up for it?\n\nAction Idea: Start with trying 1 Pomodoro today. Twenty-five minutes of concentrated work on one task. Start with one and work up from there.\nWant to go further?\n",

        "description": "We live in The Age of Dramatic Distraction. Many shiny toys to chase every waking moment yet so few of those pursuits create real value and grow a life brilliantly lived.\n\nToo many of us are overscheduled, overconnected and overstimulated by all the noise, interruptions and complexity of current society.\n\nThe cost of this way of operating? You’ll arrive at the last hour of your final day and realize you spent your highest potential on your lowest leverage activities.\n\nEpic performers, A-Players and World-Builders play a very different game. The Elon Musks, The Mark Zuckerbergs, great artists and top scientists all run their days under completely different mindsets and rituals than those who get trapped in the groove of “being busy being busy.”\n\nAs a private coach to many of the most successful entrepreneurs on the planet and founder of The Titan Summit which brings together ultra-performers from 43+ nations for 4 days of elite training on productivity, business acceleration and lifestyle optimization every December in Toronto, I’ve observed first hand how human beings who get more done in a week than most get done in a quarter realize their results. I’ve also developed a complete methodology for exponential productivity that I teach participants at this event.\n\nHere are 4 of the game-changing elements of my approach:\n\n#1. The 20/20/20 Formula.\n\nThe way you start your day powerfully shapes how productively you live it. Reserve the first 60 minutes for personal preparation. As the Spartan warriors said: “Sweat more in training and you’ll bleed less at war.” Spend your first 20 minutes in intense exercise. Sweating releases BDNF, a brain chemical that actually grows neural connections. Working out also releases dopamine (the neurotransmitter of motivation) and serotonin, which makes you feel happy.\n\nFor the next “20 minute pocket”, review your annual plan and reflect deeply on your quarterly goals. Clarity precedes mastery and this practice will deepen your focus through the day.\n\nInvest the final 20 minutes of this morning routine on learning (i.e., read autobiographies of great humans or listen to a leadership podcast or download the lessons of yesterday into your journal).\n\n#2. The 90/90/1 Rule.\n\nThis habit alone has delivered vast value for my clients. Simply stated: for the next 90 days, dedicate the first 90 minutes of your work day to your single most important opportunity, the one thing that if you executed on it flawlessly, would cause everything to rise.\n\nAverage performers get to work and check their email or surf the net. For the true leader, reaching the office is the start of showtime. They understand that developing a monomaniacal focus on their vital few priorities unleashes legendary results.\n\n#3. The 60/10 Method.\n\nGood research confirms that what makes the best athletes the best in the world was not what they did in their sport but how effectively they recovered. For example, it was the rituals that star tennis players did in between points that made them stars. What made the Russian weightlifters so undefeatable was their “work-rest ratios”.\n\nSo, set a timer for 60 minutes and during those intervals, turn off your technology, shut your door and dive — with massive intensity — into the project that matters. Then, recover with a pristine break like walking, listening to music or reading. Just try this protocol for a month and witness the gains.\n\n#4. Find Your Circle of Genius.\n\nBehavioral scientists have discovered the phenomenon of “emotional contagion.” This describes the fact that, unconsciously, we adopt the beliefs, feelings and behaviors of the people we spend most of our time with.\n\nWant to get ultra-fit? One of the finest ways is to join a running group or make friends with athletes. Ready to be happier? Then remove the energy vampires and complainers from your life. Set to build a truly world-class company? Then start spending far more time with those who have been there and done it. Their mindsets and ways of being will automatically influence you, over time. And associating with people whose lives you want to be living shows you what’s possible. And once you know more, you can achieve more.\n\nFinally, please allow me to remind you about the shortness of life. Even the longest one is a relatively short ride. You owe it to the talent you were born into, the team you lead, the family you love and the world that longs for you to display your greatness to do whatever it takes to reach exponential productivity.\n\nHopefully, you’ll embrace the methodology I’ve shared to fulfill your leadership potential.\n\nAs always, I hope this message has delivered real value to you and sets you up to finish what remains of this year “in the rare air of outright mastery.”\n\nYour partner in leadership + success",

        "title": "5 Smart Ways To Increase Your Confidence, Productivity, and Income",
        "description": "“Success” isn’t just having lots of money. Many people with lots of money have horribly unhappy and radically imbalanced lives.\n\nSuccess is continuously improving who you are, how you live, how you serve, and how you relate.\n\nSo why won’t most people be successful?\n\nWhy don’t most people evolve?\n\nThe more evolved you become, the more focused you must be on those few things which matter most. Yet, as Jim Rohn has said, “A lot of people don’t do well simply because they major in minor things.”\n\nThis article is a break-down of 5 smart ways to focus on the major things in your life. The result is that you’ll have more confidence, productivity, and income.\n\nHere they are:\n1. Deal With 5 Minutes Of Pain Every Morning (And then enjoy several hours of peak productivity and fulfillment)\n\nThe first three hours of your day will make or break your success in life, according to psychologist Ron Friedman. And he’s right.\n\nSaid he:\n\n    “Typically, we have a window of about three hours where we’re really, really focused.”\n\nYour challenge, in all seriousness, is learning how to deal with five minutes of pain.\n\nBecause when you set your alarm and wake up early, it will suck. It feels absolutely terrible to wake up early.\n\nBut it only really feels terrible for five minutes, if you immediately get of bed and do something.\n\nOtherwise, you compound the pain by either staying in bed or by falling back asleep and feeling regret. And the longer you sit in bed, the worse it gets. Research shows that the longer you hesitate to do something, the less likely you are to do it.\n\nThe longer you sit in bed after your alarm goes off, the less likely you’ll actually get out of bed.\n\nThere are three fundamental problems with laying in bed after your alarm goes off:\n\n    You’re LYING to yourself. The night before, when you set the alarm, you told yourself you’d GET UP when that alarm went off. By lying to yourself, you’re living in a state of internal conflict. The opposite of self-deception is self-trust, which is another word for confidence. Research in psychology has found that confidence is NOT A CAUSE, but rather, an effect. You gain confidence by doing what you say you’re going to do.\n    Would you make an important decision, such as a large financial investment, while in an exhausted and mentally-fogged state? Probably not. Then why would you decide WHEN TO GET UP while in such a state? The state in which you make your decisions determines the quality of those decisions. Thus, you should make the decision about when to get up, not while you’re exhausted and lying in that comfortable bed, but the night before while you’re clear (see #23). Then, the moment your alarm goes off, immediately act upon the decision you previously made. Trust that decision. You made it for a reason. If you make your first decision of the day in a reactive manner, what tone are you setting for the rest of the day? Similarly, what tone are you setting for the rest of your life?\n    The pain of waking up only lasts five minutes. Usually less, actually, if you have a strategy for waking yourself up. When your alarm goes off, don’t give yourself time to negotiate with your bed. Get up immediately and proactively DO SOMETHING to wake yourself up. That could be getting in the shower immediately. It could be going to a different room. I myself get up, put on my shoes, walk straight to my car, and drive to a parking lot outside of my neighborhood to do some reading and journal writing. Usually, I’m already feeling great while in the car. The main idea is that you want to CHANGE ENVIRONMENTS as quickly as possible. Your bedroom subconsciously triggers, especially at that time in the morning, the desire to sleep. When you change environments, even just going to the bathroom and flipping on the light, you’ll be more alert. Research in psychology shows that changing your environment enhances your mindfulness.\n\nThat five minutes of pain is the barrier stopping the majority of people from waking up early.\n\nThat five minutes of pain can quite literally separate you — mentally, spiritually, socioeconomically, and in all other ways — from most people.\n\nFive minutes is likely the distinguishing factor of whether you’ll have a great day or an average one. Similarly, 30 days is the difference between having bad habits and good ones.\n\nYet, most people remain on the WRONG SIDE of those five minutes and those 30 days. If they’d just endure some short difficulty, they’d open themselves to a world of opportunity. Yet, they cheat themselves and remain stuck, always WANTING to make the change, but not being willing to endure a short duration of purging.\n\nWaking up early, and developing a strategic routine can transform you into a very intelligent, spiritual, organized, and successful person within a relatively short period of time (approx. 1–10 years).\n\nNot convinced? Check out these quotes:\n\n“Lose an hour in the morning, and you will be all day hunting for it.”\n\n— Richard Whately\n\n“The early morning has gold in its mouth.”\n\n— Benjamin Franklin\n\n“The difference between rising at five and seven o’clock in the morning, for forty years, supposing a man to go to bed at the same hour at night, is nearly equivalent to the addition of ten years to a man’s life.”\n\n— Philip Doddridge\n\n“It is well to be up before daybreak, for such habits contribute to health, wealth, and wisdom.”\n\n— Aristotle\n\n“The sun has not caught me in bed in fifty years.”\n\n— Thomas Jefferson\n\n“One key to success is to have lunch at the time of day most people have breakfast.”\n\n— Robert Brault\n2. Start Your Day With Your #1 Priority (Not what’s urgent)\n\nIt’s easy to start the day with something that seems good but ultimately isn’t all that important.\n\nJim Collins said, “Good is the enemy of great.”\n\nThere are countless good things you could do.\n\nBut what is the FIRST thing you should do?\n\nWhat’s the ideal way to START your day?\n\nThat depends on your #1 priority in life. If it’s your faith, you should probably connect with God and increase your faith. If it’s your business, you should probably get moving on your business.\n\nFor several years, the first thing I did in the morning was to go to the gym. And although health and fitness are essential to me, they are not my #1 priority.\n\nIf you don’t make time for your #1 priority, then is it really a priority?\n\nIn the book, 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen Covey explains the importance of putting “first things, first.” To illustrate the concept, Covey puts several rocks in a bucket. When you put the little rocks in first, you can’t fit all of the big rocks. But when you start with the big rocks, the little rocks can easy fill the empty spaces.\n\nHow you start something determines your trajectory.\n\nGetting up early isn’t enough. You need to put first things first. When you put your top priorities first, then you ensure they make it into the bucket of your day. After your main priorities have been completed, the rest will fill the gaps.\n\nThis is essential to quality decision making. The best decision makers do things that simultaneously make everything else in their life easy.\n\nYou make ONE decision that makes several other decisions either irrelevant or easier. When you fill your time only with THE BEST, then everything else takes care of itself. The distractions and lower priorities are either given their allotted time or they disappear from your life. Because you already filled your life with stuff of much higher value.\n3. Face Your Resistance & Do What You’re Avoiding (That one thing that really matters, and will matter in 10 years, that you don’t want to do)\n\n“I know that each of us has much to do. Sometimes we feel overwhelmed by the tasks we face. But if we keep our priorities in order, we can accomplish all that we should.”\n\n— Joseph Wirthlin\n\nIf you’ve been resisting doing something for a while, everything else in your life will suffer.\n\nFor example, I’m very close to finishing my PhD. But there are some things related to completing my PhD that I’ve been avoiding/procrastinating.\n\nI can very easily fill my time with a lot of other really cool, important, and interesting things.\n\nBut always in the back of my mind, I know I’m neglecting something that’s crucial to my personal goals. I’m putting off something that really matters to me. Thus, I’m living in a state of incongruence.\n\nInterestingly, WHEN I FINALLY GET MYSELF to work on my dissertation, even for just a few hours, I immediately feel a SURGE OF ENERGY toward the other important stuff in my life.\n\nI begin to feel hope that I can succeed.\n\nI begin to see more beauty in life and in the people around me.\n\nI begin to feel motivated to succeed in my health, my relationships, and my other goals.\n4. Embrace Multiple Learning Styles (It all happens when you face the resistance and put first things first)\n\n“Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty.”\n\n— Henry Ford\n\nAccording to 50 years of research on learning theory, we all have a dominant learning style. We all also have several backup learning styles we rely on when we’re in a difficult situation. However, there are also several other learning styles that each of us neglect and avoid.\n\nInterestingly, most people have a “growth” mindset about the learning style they are comfortable with. For example, if you like math and learn in analytical ways, you probably believe you can get better at math. You probably approach challenges and failures as opportunities to grow. You probably seek out mentoring, education, and help. You’re probably curious and seeking to expand your knowledge and horizon about that thing.\n\nHowever, most people have a “fixed” mindset about the learning styles they aren’t comfortable with. For example, if you don’t like writing, you probably believe you can’t get better at it. There are some things YOU simply can’t learn. They aren’t in your DNA or something, right?\n\nMuch of the work related to my dissertation is way outside of my dominant learning style (such as heavy statistics). Hence, I avoid doing it. I much prefer work that’s in alignment with my dominant and developed learning styles (like writing and teaching).\n\nHowever, when you engage in an activity that you resist, you active areas of your brain and emotions that you’ve suppressed.\n\nYou make tangible progress toward goals that are currently outside your comfort zone.\n\nYou open yourself to a new world of learning and experience.\n\nYou make new connections in your brain.\n\nYou gain confidence in yourself by watching yourself do something difficult.\n\nYou gain more confidence by doing something you believe you should do, and intrinsically want to do, but that is difficult.\n\nI see many people, for example, who want to be artists — whether that be a writer, musician, etc.\n\nBut many of these people never succeed because the business and marketing side of being an artist is outside of their dominant learning style. And they refuse to learn those essential components.\n\nThey have a fixed-mindset about business and marketing and therefore end up settling for a life they don’t really want.\n\nIronically, if they’d just get good at business and embrace some of their difficult emotions and underdeveloped learning styles, THEIR ART WOULD IMPROVE.\n\nIt would improve because they’d demonstrate to themselves how truly committed they are to their dreams. They’re committed enough to do stuff that sucks. They’re committed to not just being a dreamer, but a professional.\n5. How You Do Anything Is How You Do Everything — This Is Fact (When you’re out of alignment, your whole life becomes a mess)\n\n“You cannot simultaneously want to eat a chocolate cake every day in front of the TV and want to be slim. You cannot want to be single and carefree and want to be in a loving, exclusive relationship.”\n\n— Malti Bhojwani\n\nWhen one area of your life is out of alignment, everything else suffers.\n\nYou may compensate in one area of life for a while. For example, you may obsess about your work or your health, while neglecting your higher priorities.\n\nBut this is extremely unsustainable.

Face Your Resistance & Do What You’re Avoiding (That one thing that really matters, and will matter in 10 years, that you don’t want to do)\n\n“I know that each of us has much to do.

        "description": "When I was 17 years old, I used to work and study for about 20 hours a day. I went to school, did my homework during breaks and managed a not-for-profit organization at night. At that time, working long hours landed me countless national campaigns, opportunities to work with A-list organizations and a successful career. As I got older, I started to think differently. I realized that working more is not always the right, or only, path to success.\r\nSometimes, working less can actually produce better results.\r\n\r\nConsider a small business owner who works nonstop. Working hard won’t help him compete with his corporate competitors. That’s because time is a limited commodity. An entrepreneur could work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, but his or her competitor can always spend more money, assemble a team and spend a lot more collective man hours on the same project. Then why have small startups accomplished things that some larger corporations couldn’t? Facebook bought Instagram, a company with 13 employees at the time, for one billion dollars. Snapchat, a startup with 30 employees, was turning down offers from Facebook and Google. Part of each of their successes was based on luck, and some on efficiency.\r\n\r\n    The key to success is not working hard. It’s working smart.\r\n\r\nThere’s a notable distinction between being busy and being productive. Being busy doesn’t always necessarily mean you’re being productive. Despite what some might believe, being productive is less about time management and more on managing your energy. It’s the business of life. It’s learning how to spend the least amount of energy to get the most benefits. I personally learned how to reduce my work week from 80 hours to 40 hours, and get a lot more work done in the process. For me, less is more.\r\nHere are seven things I stopped doing to become more productive.\r\n1. Stop working overtime and increase your productivity instead.\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered where the five-day, 40-hour work week came from? In 1926, Henry Ford, American industrialist and founder of Ford Motor Company, conducted an experiment with his own staff:\r\n\r\n    He decreased their daily hours from 10 to 8, and shortened the work week from 6 days to 5. As a result, he saw his workers’ productivity increase.\r\n\r\nThe more you work, the less effective and productive you become over both the short and long term, states a 1980 report from The Business Roundtable titled “Scheduled Overtime Effect on Construction Projects.”\r\n\r\n    “Where a work schedule of 60 or more hours per week is continued longer than about two months, the cumulative effect of decreased productivity will cause a delay in the completion date beyond that which could have been realized with the same crew size on a 40-hour week.”\r\n\r\n    Source: Calculating Loss of Productivity Due to Overtime Using Published Charts — Fact or Fiction\r\n\r\nIn an article for AlterNet, editor Sara Robinson referenced research conducted by the US military which revealed that “losing just one hour of sleep per night for a week will cause a level of cognitive degradation equivalent to a .10 blood alcohol level.” You can get fired for coming to work drunk, but it’s acceptable to pull an all-nighter.\r\n\r\n    Irrespective of how well you were able to get on with your day after that most recent night without sleep, it is unlikely that you felt especially upbeat and joyous about the world. Your more-negative-than-usual perspective will have resulted from a generalized low mood, which is a normal consequence of being overtired. More important than just the mood, this mind-set is often accompanied by decreases in willingness to think and act proactively, control impulses, feel positive about yourself, empathize with others, and generally use emotional intelligence.\r\n\r\n    Source: The Secret World of Sleep: The Surprising Science of the Mind at Rest\r\n\r\nIt’s important for us not to overwork ourselves and get enough sleep to maintain a high level of productivity. Next time you’re wondering why you may not be working productively, the reason may be simple as you being deprived of adequate sleep. (James Maas, a sleep researcher and expert, revealed that at least seven out of every 10 Americans don’t get enough sleep.)\r\nDid you know?\r\n\r\n    Leonardo da Vinci took multiple naps a day and slept less at night.\r\n    The French emperor Napoleon was not shy about taking naps. He indulged daily.\r\n    Though Thomas Edison was embarrassed about his napping habit, he also practiced this ritual on a daily basis.\r\n    Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, used to boost her energy before speaking engagements by napping.\r\n    Gene Autry, “the Singing Cowboy,” routinely took naps in his dressing room between performances.\r\n    President John F. Kennedy ate his lunch in bed and then settled in for a nap—every day!\r\n    Oil industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller napped every afternoon in his office.\r\n    Winston Churchill’s afternoon nap was a non-negotiable. He believed it helped him get twice as much done each day.\r\n    President Lyndon B. Johnson took a nap every afternoon at 3:30 p.m. in order to break his day up into “two shifts.”\r\n    Though he was criticized for it, President Ronald Reagan famously took naps as well.\r\n\r\nSource: 5 Reasons Why You Should Take a Nap Every Day — Michael Hyatt\r\n\r\nOn a personal note, since I started getting at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night, I’ve noticed a change: I became a lot more productive and got a lot more work done in comparison to when I worked 16 hours a day. Who knew sleeping was such a great tool for marketers?\r\n2. Don’t say “yes” too often\r\n\r\nAccording to the Pareto principle, 20 percent of the effort produces 80 percent of the results; however, 20 percent of the results consumes 80 percent of the effort. Instead of working harder, we should focus primarily on the efforts that produce the majority of the results and forgo the rest. That way, we have more time to focus on the most important tasks. Stop saying “yes” to tasks that yield little or no result.\r\n\r\n    “The difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say “no” to almost everything.”\r\n\r\n    — Warren Buffett\r\n\r\nSo what should you say “yes” to? And when should you say “no”? If you can’t figure out if something is going to be worth your time, consider running a simple split test. Consider tracking everything you do, and the time it takes to complete each task, and the results. Then go back, assess your list to see what did (or didn’t) prove fruitful, and take your findings into consideration to optimize for future tasks.\r\n\r\nMost of us say yes more often than we should, for a variety of reasons, including guilt and overstretching ourselves, but also because it is so much easier than saying no. Nobody wants to be the bad guy.\r\n\r\nIn a 2012 study published in the Journal of Consumer Research, researchers split 120 students in two groups. One group was trained to use the phrase “I can’t” when discussing the specific choices, while the other was trained to use “I don’t” in framing their decisions.\r\n\r\nThe students who told themselves “I can’t eat X” chose to eat the chocolate candy bar 61% of the time. Meanwhile, the students who told themselves “I don’t eat X” chose to eat the chocolate candy bars only 36% of the time. This simple change in terminology significantly improved the odds that each person would make a more healthy food choice.\r\n\r\nNext time you need to avoid saying yes, use “I don’t” in your refusal, to reinforce the helpful behavior of saying no to things that aren’t worth it.\r\n\r\nAnother great trick is to avoid activities that don’t add enough value to your life is the 20-second rule: For activities you shouldn’t be engaging in, or negative habits you want to break, add an element of difficulty, adding on a 20-second roadblock, so to speak, to you starting that activity. For example, if you’re trying to use lessen your use of social media, delete the tempting apps from your phone, so that it takes you another 20 seconds to find your laptop to access them. By adding in an inconvenience, you’ll be less likely to engage with that draining activity or habit.\r\n\r\n    Lower the activation energy for habits you want to adopt and raise it for habits you want to avoid. The more we can lower or even eliminate the activation energy for our desired actions, the more we enhance our ability to jump-start positive change.\r\n\r\n    Source: The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work\r\n\r\n3. Stop doing everything yourself and start letting people help you\r\n\r\nAt some point in my career, I was managing a very large community and couldn’t handle it all myself. I burnt out, and the community ended up taking over and managing itself. Surprisingly, members did a better job than I could have ever done on my own. I learned the power of community and why brands need user-generated content.\r\n\r\nConsumers understand what they want and how they want it better than any marketer does. Did you know that, according to Octoly, user-generated videos are viewed 10 times more than brand-generated videos on YouTube? When seeking information about a particular brand, over half (51 percent) of Americans trust user-generated content more than what’s on the brand’s official website (16 percent) or media coverage on the brand (14 percent). It’s important for marketers to open up and seek help from the brand’s community itself.\r\n\r\nBeing a great content marketer is not about creating the best content, but building a great community that will generate high-quality content for you.\r\n\r\nIt’s important for us to realize we can seek help when we need it. Sometimes it’s impossible to do everything ourselves. It‘s better to let someone, or a team, share the work, giving you more time to focus on the most important tasks. Instead of wasting time and energy overloading yourself or trying to do it alone, let others share the burden and help.\r\n\r\nOften times, even if your friends or coworkers can’t help you, simply having them around can help you become more productive.\r\n\r\n    Just having friends nearby can push you toward productivity. “There’s a concept in ADHD treatment called the ‘body double,’ ” says David Nowell, Ph.D., a clinical neuropsychologist from Worcester, Massachusetts. “Distractable people get more done when there is someone else there, even if he isn’t coaching or assisting them.” If you’re facing a task that is dull or difficult, such as cleaning out your closets or pulling together your receipts for tax time, get a friend to be your body double.\r\n\r\n    Source: Friendfluence: The Surprising Ways Friends Make Us Who We Are\r\n\r\n4. Stop being a perfectionist\r\n\r\n“We found that perfectionism trips up professors on the way to research productivity. The more perfectionistic the professor, the less productive they are,” Dr. Simon Sherry, a psychology professor at Dalhousie University who conducted a study on perfectionism and productivity, told University Affairs. Dr. Sherry found a robust correlation between increased perfectionism and decreased productivity.\r\n\r\nHere are some problems associated with being a perfectionist:\r\n\r\n    They spend more time than required on a task.\r\n    They procrastinate and wait for the perfect moment. In business, if it is the perfect moment, you are too late.\r\n    They miss the big picture while focusing too much on the small things.\r\n\r\nMarketers often wait for the perfect moment. In doing so, they end up missing it.\r\n\r\nThe perfect moment is NOW.\r\n5. Stop doing repetitive tasks and start automating.\r\n\r\nAccording to a research study conducted by Tethys Solutions, a team of five people who spent 3 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent, 30 percent and 70 percent of their time on repetitive tasks, respectively, reduced their time spent to 3 percent, 10 percent, 15 percent, 15 percent and 10 percent after two months of working to enhance their productivity.\r\n\r\nA week ago, I spent 15 minutes writing a basic Python program. The idea was to generate content from the data, which I pulled from Twitter API using a Ruby bot, and then using Hootsuite to bulk schedule the content. While this task used to take me an entire day to accomplish, it now takes me less than five minutes thanks to automation. Nowadays, whenever I find that I’ve done something more than five times, I ask myself if I can find a program to automate it for me.\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to be able to code to automate your repetitive tasks. It’s nice to have the skills or the resources, but it’s not a requirement. If you cannot build it, buy it.\r\n\r\nPeople often forget that time is money. People usually do things manually because it’s easy and requires almost no research. It’s manageable to moderate 30 images on Instagram for your user-generated campaign. But if you have to manage 30,000 photos and videos from five different platforms, you need a good digital asset management software. At Filemobile, we help people solve that problem and generate even more user-generated content. Just like managing rich media, you can easily purchase a software to solve almost all of your problems on the internet.\r\n\r\nIf you still can’t find a solution, you can hire an expert to help you. Keep in mind that you need to spend money to make money and that time is your most valuable commodity.\r\n\r\nTips for marketers: check out GitHub or Google Apps Script library. Often times, you’ll find free, ready-to-use open source code that requires very little programming knowledge.\r\n6. Stop guessing and start backing up your decisions with data\r\n\r\nIf you can optimize websites for search engines, you can optimize your life to grow and reach your maximum potential.\r\n\r\nThere are countless research studies that can offer insight on optimizing your productivity. For instance, did you know that most people are more easily distracted between noon to 4 p.m.? This was the conclusion that came from research shared by Robert Matchock, an associate professor of psychology at Pennsylvania State University. But even if you can’t find data on a particular question you might have, it doesn’t take a lot of time to run a simple split test and examine your own results.\r\n7. Stop working, and take some time to do nothing at all.\r\n\r\nMost people don’t realize that when we are too focused on something, we’re essentially locking ourselves in a box which can end up being counterproductive to our work or the results we’re chasing. It’s important to walk away from work once in a while and have some alone time, which is good for the brain and spirit, according to “The Power of Lonely,” from The Boston Globe.\r\n\r\n    One ongoing Harvard study indicates that people form more lasting and accurate memories if they believe they’re experiencing something alone. Another indicates that a certain amount of solitude can make a person more capable of empathy towards others. And while no one would dispute that too much isolation early in life can be unhealthy, a certain amount of solitude has been shown to help teenagers improve their moods and earn good grades in school.\r\n\r\n    Source: The Power of Lonely\r\n\r\nIt‘s important to take time for reflection. We often find the solutions we’re looking for when we’re not actively searching for them.\r\n\r\nIt’s also important to understand that we don’t become more productive overnight. Like everything in life, it requires effort and practice. Change doesn’t happen just by sitting around and waiting for it. Instead, take the time to learn more about your body and find actionable ways to optimize your energy and time for a more successful and happier life.",

        "title": "8 Qualities of Highly Productive People",
        "description": "While the vast majority of the world’s population has probably never thought about increasing their performance or productivity, there is a group of people that is constantly striving for progress.\n\nWanting to perform better, get more done, deliver more results, succeed in many ways.\n\nThose are probably the people who have read Tim Ferris’ 4-Hour Workweek, know Gary Vaynerchuk’s hustle mentality and are after building something bigger every day.\n\nThese people have a mission, something that is bigger than themselves. They are chasing to build something that has an impact on people’s lives.\n\nAt the same time, people with big dreams are the ones who are constantly working on optimizing themselves.\n\nBuilding strong habits is one of the keys when talking about self-optimization.\n\n    The right habits can help you to save time, energy and willpower.\n\nHere are 8 Qualities of Highly Productive People:\n1.) Cutting away the unimportant\n\nEspecially if you are an entrepreneur, you will know how important priorities are.\n\nWe are constantly faced with the challenge of deciding what to do and what to postpone or neglect.\n\n    Highly productive people are doing great when it comes to focusing on the important.\n\nI have recently published an article on the habits of happy people according to Warren Buffett and during my research, I came across Buffetts principle when it comes to setting priorities and focusing:\n\nBuffetts 5/25 rule is a strategy to find out your own focus.\n\nFor this method, you just have to write down 25 things that you want to do and achieve in your life.\n\nNext, you find your top five.\n\n    Once you know, what your top five priorities are, you completely focus on them.\n\nYou forget the rest, you discard the other 20 ideas and possibilities and focus all your energy on your top five.\n\nAnother way to set priorities is the Eisenhower Matrix.\n\nThis is basically a chart where you can organize your tasks according to urgency and importance.\n\nAccording to the Eisenhower Matrix you first focus on your tasks that are important and urgent, you schedule urgent but unimportant tasks, delegate important tasks that are not urgent and forget about all the rest.\n2.) Allocate breaks strategically\n\nBesides setting the right priorities, highly productive people also know when to schedule breaks.\n\nOverworking and not caring for your own health cannot end up in satisfying results.\n\nThat’s why you always have to keep an eye on your health but also on your business to see if a break is needed.\n\n    Sometimes, taking a break from the everyday business can be eye-opening and a great way to indicate new opportunities.\n\nOn the other side, also during your everyday work-life, you should schedule short breaks to ensure great productivity.\n\nMoving your body, nourishing with great food and drinking lots of water is part of these breaks.\n\nWhat also works wonders for me, when it comes to increasing my productivity is the Pomodoro Technique.\n\nTo make use of the Pomodoro Technique you set a timer to 25 minutes and focus on one task without any distraction.\n\nThen you make a 5-minute break before again working without any distraction for 25 minutes.\n3.) Remove all Productivity Killers\n\nNowadays we are surrounded by distractions all the time.\n\nIf you want to be highly efficient and productive, you have to get rid of any sort of distraction that might come into your way.\n\nEspecially, remove everything that is not work-related from your desk.\n\nTurn off notifications.\n\nGet rid of applications and other distracting pop-ups.\n\nPrepare everything that you need to get your work done in advance so that you can perform effectively once you start with the work.\n4.) Source of Inspiration\nIf we are honest, everybody has times when he is demotivated and needs some inspiration.\n\nWhat differentiates highly productive people is that they have clear sources of inspiration that work for them.\n\nThis might be a walk outside, a vision board with all their goals and dreams or a quick talk to an important person.\n\nHow you exactly get motivated and inspired is not crucial.\n\n    What is important, however, is that you have your own source of inspiration that you can come back to once you lack motivation.\n\n5.) Don’t make yourself too accessible\n\nAlso here, I want to make use of a great article explaining how Warren Buffet explains the key to being successful.\n\nIf you are an entrepreneur, especially in the beginnings it can be tempting to join a lot of events, network and say yes to every opportunity that arises.\n\nHowever, what differentiates highly productive people is that they don’t make themselves too accessible.\n\nThey focus on the relevant and on increasing their own performance.\n\nSure, collaborations and sometimes saying yes to a project can be a huge door opener, but if you say yes to everything and are too open, you will never be able to be in a state of high productivity on the long run.\n\n6.) Optimizing Time Pockets\nHighly productive people know how to make use of every minute.\n\nThere are so many opportunities to optimize the usage of free time throughout your day.\n\nEven during your commute to work, while sitting in a waiting room or doing your groceries, you can use your time wisely.\n\nMy most favorite ways to make use of this spare time is educating myself through podcasts and audiobooks.\n\nThis way, I can consume high-quality content which is a great source of inspiration instead of losing time.\n\n7.) Setting Timelines and Deadlines\n\nIf you are working on becoming more productive and efficient, timelines and deadlines must soon become your best friends.\n\nEspecially Parkinson’s Law is a concept that you will have to be aware of when it comes to increasing your productivity.\n\n    Parkinson’s law is the adage that “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion”.\n\nMost people get overwhelmed by completing tasks and to-do’s because they work too much on the tiny details which are not necessarily important.\n\nIncreasing your productivity should definitely not mean delivering bad results, however, getting lost in the details and spending too much time with perfectionism can be your #1 productivity killer.\n\n    Good is good enough.\n\n8.) Automation\nLast but not least, what highly productive people have in common is that they are constantly working on automating processes and workflows.\n\nOnce you know your goals and set up certain strategies on what needs to be done in order to achieve them there are many ways on how to optimize and automate your processes.\n\nThis can be done through outsourcing, delegation or simple automation through technology.\n\nThe easiest and cheapest way to outsource small tasks is to make use of freelancing platforms like Fiverr.\n\nIf you truly want to become more productive, take a look at your day and identify all the tasks that you work on, which you could automate.\n\nOnce you manage to automate those tasks, you can focus on things that have more impact on your projects, goals and yourself.The 7 Habits of Highly Productive People\nThe right habits can help you save time, energy, and willpower.",

        "title": "4 Habits That Will Dramatically Improve Your Productivity",
        "description": "If you want to seriously improve your productivity, your guiding principle should be: Less but better.\n\nMost people who want to be more productive waste their time and energy on cheap productivity hacks and silly time management techniques.\n\nLike the writer who spends hours reading articles and books about how to be a writer instead of sitting their butts in a chair and writing, it’s all too easy to get addicted to productivity porn—constantly tinkering with a never-ending stream of tips and tricks that may feel good in the moment, but it ultimately lead nowhere.\n\nWhat you really need is better habits.\n\nIf you’re ready to get serious about becoming more productive, here are 4 psychologically-sophisticated habits that will dramatically boost your productivity and focus.\n1. Stop fighting procrastination and learn to use it.\n\nEverybody feels the urge to procrastinate — it’s how we respond to that urge that separates the wannabes from the truly productive.\n\nThe desire to procrastinate is normal, healthy even. It’s your mind expressing its natural desire for novelty and curiosity. And no matter how committed to a particular task or piece of work, you will occasionally feel the urge to put off getting to work in favor of something more immediately enjoyable or interesting.\n\n    To stay productive, you must change the way you think about procrastination.\n\nOften the people who struggle the most with procrastination have harsh, judgmental beliefs about what it means to even feel like procrastinating. And these beliefs come out in the form of negative self-talk toward themselves:\n\n    What’s wrong with me?! Why can’t I just get my sh*t together and focus!\n    There I go again… I wish I wasn’t such a procrastinator!\n    Look at Tom. He’s such a machine. He just sits down and gets to work. I wish I was as disciplined as he is.\n\nThe trouble with all the judgmental negative self-talk is that it adds a second layer of negative emotion onto your experience: Instead of just feeling like you don’t want to work, you also feel ashamed or angry or disappointed in yourself.\n\nNow the urge to procrastinate is even stronger because distracting yourself with some cheap pleasure or entertainment is also a quick way to avoid the negative feels that came from your nasty self-talk.\n\nThe way out of this vicious cycle is to fundamentally change the way you think about and respond to the urge to procrastinate:\n\n    Simply observe and notice your urge to procrastinate. Also, watch for any thoughts and feeling that automatically spring up in response to it. This is called meta-cognition — thinking about your thinking. It’s beneficial because it slows you down and helps short-circuit the default behavior of negative self-talk or immediate distraction.\n    Label and accept your urge to procrastinate non-judgmentally. Simply acknowledge that you are in fact feeling the urge to procrastinate. But distinguish for yourself that just because you feel the urge doesn’t mean you have to act on it.\n    Validate the urge to procrastinate. Remind yourself that it’s normal and valid to feel like procrastinating. You can also tell yourself that everybody feels the urge to procrastinate and that you’re not alone. Finally, if it helps, remind yourself of a time when you successfully got to work despite feeling like procrastinating. This will increase your confidence and self-efficacy and make it more likely that you choose to get to work despite your desire to procrastinate.\n    Invite your procrastination along for the ride. Literally tell your urge to procrastinate that you’re willing for it to stick around as you get to work. By approaching (rather than avoiding) the desire to procrastinate, you’re training your brain to see it as something neutral rather than a threat. This will help lessen its intensity in the future.\n\nBy habitually criticizing yourself for your tendency to procrastinate, you’re making it harder to resit and training your brain to treat it as something dangerous in the future — both of which make it that much harder to simply get to work.\n\n    Instead of fighting with your procrastination, practice validating it and be willing to live with it.\n\n2. Ruthlessly eliminate digital distractions.\n\nIt’s not all in your head. Often the biggest obstacles to genuine productivity are on our desks, in our pockets, or inside the browser on our computer.\n\nIf you’re the kind of person reading an article like this one on how to be more productive, you probably have an internal locus of control bias. Meaning, you like the idea that being more productive is something within you — how you think, how you behave, what you want, etc.\n\nBut often the biggest reason we procrastinate and lose focus is our environment, specifically, our digital environment:\n\n    The Twitter notification that just dinged\n    The email that just popped up on your desktop\n    That new game you just installed on your phone yesterday\n\nLosing focus doesn’t necessarily mean our willpower muscle was weak; it may simply mean that the distractions in your environment are strong. And that before you even have time to consider engaging your will-power or self-control muscle, your attention has already gravitated toward a distraction and you’ve lost focus.\n\n    Willpower should only be a last resort. Better to design your environment so that you don’t need it in the first place.\n\nBefore you sit down to work, make sure you’ve done everything you can to make sure your environment is conducive to work and focus rather than distracting:\n\n    Implement the 4:55 Drill. The 4:55 Drill is a little technique I use to eliminate distractions and help me dive right into my most important and creative work. Often, we end up procrastinating because of the prep work needed just to figure out what we should be working on. Digging around in our email for something is a great way to get sidetracked into the depths of the internet. Instead, at the end of each workday (hence the 4:55 Drill), take 5 minutes and get yourself organized for the following day. Decide on the one or two things you’d like to accomplish first thing and assemble everything you need now so that’s you can hit the ground running tomorrow morning.\n    Quarantine your phone. Face it: as powerful and wonderful as smartphones are, they’re also our biggest source of procrastination and loss of focus. I suggest not even trying to resist them, and instead, turn them off and put them out of sight. When I sit down to do serious work, I power down my phone completely and put in out of sight in a drawer. This means that not only will I not get distracted by notifications, but the mere sight of my phone won’t even be there as a distraction. What’s more, knowing that it’s powered off, means that there’s a lot more friction to simply checking my email or twitter — I would have to spend the extra 30 seconds to power on my phone. Often this is enough friction to make that temptation unattractive.\n    Turn your computer into a single-tasking machine. If you’re any kind of knowledge worker, chances are your work is primarily done on a computer — writing documents, drafting reports, assembling presentations, etc. Unfortunately for your productivity, your computer is capable of doing all sorts of other fun and interesting tasks. Try this: before you start working, close down every application, window, program, and service except for the one or two that are absolutely essential to your work. Make your computer into a tool that only does one thing, and you’ll be far less tempted to use it to do other things.\n\nMost digital distractions shroud themselves in a cloak of harmlessness and usefulness. As a result, we allow them to linger while we work.\n\nBut underneath that shallow veneer are powerful forces pulling you toward distraction and procrastination. And if you exert all your energy trying to resist these distractions, you’re cutting into the energy that should be dedicated to doing your best, most creative work.\n\n    Get ruthless about eliminating distractions during your most important work — especially digital distractions.\n\n3. Cultivate a deep work routine.\n\nCal Newport coined the phrase deep work in his book of the same name and describes it like this:\n\n    Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.\n\nDeep work is your mind in high-gear.\n\nIt’s when you are working at close to your full potential, producing creative, high-quality work in a way that’s efficient and prolific. It’s the holy grain of productivity.\n\nThe problem is, because it’s so mentally taxing, it’s very hard to do. And it’s extremely hard to do consistently. Which is where the term routine comes in…\n\nRoutines solve two big problems when it comes to deep work:\n\n    You can’t just sit down and expect your mind to jump to 100% capacity and crank out an hour of highly-focused, creative work. You have to build up to it gradually. You need to train your mind to adjust to deep work, which is a very different way of operating than our standard, semi-distracted way of working.\n    You need a system for keeping you consistent with your deep work. If you’re constantly being interrupted by coworkers or tempted to procrastinate by social media, you’ll never stay consistent with deep work.\n\nA solid deep work routine solves both of these problems.\n\nHere’s how to get started creating your own deep work routine:\n\n    Decide on a consistent time for your deep work. Ideally, it’s a consistent time several days per week. First thing in the morning when I get to the office, for example. Whatever you chose, you must make that time sacred.\n    Start small with a duration and gradually work up. Initially, I recommend doing deep work in 20-minute bursts. After a week or so, you can up it to 30 minutes. Ideal results tend to come when you can work in stretches of 45 to 60 minutes of focused, distraction free time.\n    Ruthlessly eliminate distractions. See section #2 above. Importantly, it’s not enough to simply remove the distraction itself (e.g. Twitter notifications turned off). You should try your best to remove even the temptation to get distracted (e.g. leave your phone in your car or another room).\n    Track progress and reward yourself. Create a simple tracking system to measure progress and reward yourself. I like the Seinfeld Strategy, which involves marking off days on a calendar after I’ve completed my deep work and trying not to “break the chain.” I also, reward myself for finishing by making a fancy cup of coffee afterward.\n\n    Deep work is a productivity superpower. But to harness it, you need an airtight routine to stay committed.\n\n4. Harness the power of forcing functions\n\nA forcing function is a mechanism that forces you to take some kind of action. It’s the antidote to inconsistent willpower or motivation.\n\nWhen a pop-up takes over your screen and asks if you want to save 50% on this month’s newest styles, it forces you into one of two decisions — click the big green “YES” button or spend 3 minutes hunting for the tiny, barely-visible “x” to close out of the popup.\n\nMarketers and salespeople use forcing functions all the time to increase the odds that a potential customer becomes an actual customer. But forcing functions can be just as useful for personal productivity.\n\nSuppose I really wanted to get this article done by Monday, but I kept procrastinating on writing it. I could write a check for $100 and make it out to my buddy Todd, telling him that if I hadn’t emailed him a completed draft of this article by Monday at 5:00 pm, he should immediately cash the check and buy himself something.\n\nThat’s a forcing function. By putting $100 dollars on the line, I’m forcing (or at least strongly encouraging) myself to follow through on my goals instead of getting distracted by short-term desires.\n\n    Exceptionally productive people are masters of self-imposed forcing functions.\n\nThey have the humility to realize that distractions are prevalent, motivation sometimes wanes, and in general, we’re all a lot less disciplined than we’d like to be. So, instead of hoping for the best, they assume the worst and plan accordingly.\n\nHere are a few good examples of forcing functions you can use to improve your productivity:\n\n    If you want to get a lot of work done quickly, take your laptop but no charger and work at the coffee shop (hat tip: Dan Martell).\n    If you want to get more work done in your home office, remove the TV and uninstall all apps from your computer that aren’t directly related to your work.\n    Hire a coach and pre-pay for several months worth of sessions.\n    Tell you assistant or spouse to change your social media passwords until beginning of each month and not tell you the new ones until you’ve completed a particular goal or project (hat tip: James Clear in Atomic Habits).\n\n    Never rely on motivation. Design systems that incentivize you to do the work no matter how you feel.\n\nAll you need to know\n\nIf you want to dramatically improve your personal productivity stop fiddling around with trivial hacks and get serious about building rigorous habits to boost your motivation, concentration, and discipline:\n\nStop fighting procrastination and learn to validate it.\n\nRuthlessly eliminate digital distractions.\n\nCultivate a deep work routine.\n\nHarness the power of forcing functions.",

        "title": "Help yourself by first helping others",
        "description": "    “When we give cheerfully and accept gratefully, everyone is blessed.”\n    ― Maya Angelou\n\nEveryone needs help once in a while. We all find ourselves in a spot where we need to hold on to someone else’s hand in order for us not to drown. But receiving help is becoming extremely rare, very few people are willing to lend a hand.\n\nWe are living in an age where most of us are so busy with our lives that we have no time to help others. Can you blame us? We can barely deal with our own problems or keep up with the many distractions around us, how can we even think of helping someone else? Why even bother, right? Wrong.\n\nWhen we do good to others and offer a helping hand, the recipients of our kindness aren’t the only ones reaping the benefits. The benefits of offering help also extend to the one giving the help. Among the hundreds of benfits that come with you helping others, five of them do stand out to me.\n\nAllow me to share them with you.\nHelping others will build better relationships for you.\n\nThe act of helping someone else is a positive act, it gives off a positive vibe to others. Others, who like everyone else, are weighed down with the world’s never ending negativity.\n\nPeople are attracted to positive vibes.\n\nThis may improve your current relationships and create new ones with people who wish to have the same. A lot of people appreciate a helping hand in their hour of need and even though it may have not meant much to you, it may have meant the world to them and they would never forget it.\n\nWhen you become a source of genuine help to your friends you can build life long bonds.\nHelping others will make you feel empowered.\n\nEmpowered to do what?\n\nTo take on bigger tasks.\n\nHow so?\n\nWell, helping someone out will leave you feeling rewarded and fulfilled. This rich feeling has the ability to provide you with the motivation, drive and purpose to do “more” with your life. What the “more” is is entirely up to you.\nIt helps you cultivate gratitude\n\nSomeone who needs help is lacking something, and if you can provide the help to that person then you have what he is lacking.\n\nBut we rarely see what other people are lacking unless we have an attitude that is willing to identify the areas in their life that the need help with.\n\nWhen we help others and see what they might be lacking, we develop a sense of gratitude for the things we have.\n\nI used to help my grandmother with her grocery shopping, she envied the young strength I had to swiftly move between aisles and grab her groceries. This showed me that even the strength that I have in my youth is something that I should be grateful for because someone out there does not have it and they really need it.\n\nHelping others can give us a perspective on our own situation and teach us to be thankful for what we have.\nImproves your self-confidence and self-esteem\n\nThe experience of helping others can lead to a sense of greater self-worth and confidence. The act of helping is a ‘good’ act. ‘Good’ acts fill you with a strong sense of self- worth, usually the greater the act the stronger your self-worth will be.\n\nThis has been noted in many people who do volunteer work.\n\nVolunteering can provide you with a sense of purpose, especially in tough times. People who volunteer have been found to have higher self-esteem and overall well-being. Experts explain that as feelings of social connectedness increase, so does your self-esteem.\n\nYou may lack confidence in your abilities until you discover the countless ways you can enrich the lives of another. When you provide value to others, you gain confidence in your personal skills and intellect.\nHelping others will help you to build a rich network\n\nWhen you help someone a few times, you make them part of your network.\nNetworks connect us with resources; they can build us and help us when we are in need. Networks empower us. The more people you help the larger your network becomes.\n\nI still remember the person who helped me deliver my very first resume to his friend who was a human resource manager at a certain company. That act which may have seemed so simple to him landed me my first job which enabled me to be able to pay for my exam fees and complete education. I will never forget that. We were not friends before that but now we are.\n\nHelping others will make you grow a network that will provide even greater help to you than you may have anticipated.\nConclusion\n\nWe should not be in the habit of turning people away when we can help them. Rather we should be looking for ways to ease the burden of others. It does not necessarily have to be huge acts, even small acts which we may take for granted may be life changing to them\n\nWhen we offer to help someone else, they benefit. But so do we. Sometimes a lot more than them.\n\nDo you know of any other benefits that you have received from helping others? Share them in the comment section below.",

        "description": "\nMost of us always try to find answers to this question “How to motivate yourself and stay motivated?”\n\nHaven’t you?\n\nI believe that’s what you are here for 🙂\n\nNot just that, people from different areas of life ask it in their own versions like…\n\nStudents ask “How to motivate yourself to study?”\n\nTeachers ask “How to motivate students?”\n\nFitness enthusiasts ask “How to motivate yourself to work out?”\n\nThose who want to lose weight ask “How to motivate yourself to lose weight?”\n\nProfessionals ask “How to stay motivated at work?”\n\nEmployers ask “How to motivate employees?”\n\nAnd so on…\n\nThis means people like you and I, feel that motivation is important. Therefore, you might ask yourself ‘how can I motivate myself to change my life’.\nWhy Motivation Is Important To Anyone?\n\nIt is because most of the people believe that motivation is important to maintain consistency and ultimately succeed in any endeavor of life.\n\nIt helps to increase your productivity, level of efforts and get through tough times.\n\nIt also makes your journey more fun and helps to influence others too.\n\nBut there is one major problem with motivation…\n\nYou must have faced that. It doesn’t last long.\nWhy Motivation Sucks?\n\nMotivation doesn’t last and that’s why people ask “How to stay motivated?”\n\nMotivation is like a quick sugar rush. You get that spike and feel on top of the world. And after some time..poof!!! You are back to square one.\n\nYou must have thought about how you can stay motivated throughout the day, week, month, year or your entire life.\n\nThis is the mistake you and I do. Motivation is just like taking your another meal or bathing.\n\nYou need it on a regular basis. We’ll discuss it in the upcoming section in the article.\n\nBut if motivation cannot push you through then what?\n\nMore than motivation, you need a system or routine in place that can ensure that you stay motivated and get things done which are important to you.\n\nHow to keep yourself motivated?\n\nHere are 4 steps that you can implement in your life to create a pull rather than pushing yourself.\nHow To Motivate Yourself To Do The Impossible?\n1. Setting Up The Right Foundation For A Long Term Game\nUnleash The Biggest ‘WHY’“\n\nHe who has a WHY to live can bear almost any how.” ~Fredrick Nietzsche\n\nRemember a time, when you had to prepare for a job interview, you had a deadline to meet, or your loved one was in need.\n\nWeren’t you super-productive at that time?\n\nDid you need anything else to motivate you to work?\n\nWhy was it so?\n\nBecause you had a clear purpose, a Big WHY!\n\nBut we rarely create a Big WHY for our daily routine and that’s the major reason why people search for motivation from the outside. If you can give the same sense of purpose to your daily life, believe me, you are set to do wonders.\n\nLearn how to find your purpose and passion in life, it will help you push through any kind of challenges.\nHow To Find The Biggest WHY?\n\nFor that you need to ask multiple “Whys” to reach the ultimate root, the big-enough reason which can drive you. That big-enough reason which is impossible for you to ignore.\n\nIt is like an onion. You peel off the layers one by one till you reach the core.\n\nAsk at least 5 Whys.\n\nContemplate about it, find top 3 reasons, write it down in your journal, make it your wallpaper in your cellphone/laptop, or stick it on the wall of your room.\n\nKeep it at a place where you can see it frequently and etch it across your mind.\n\n[Pro Stuff: I have created an audio tool that you can use to find your Biggest WHY. Get instant access for free]\n\nIf you are able to find that one big-enough reason, it will have the ability to take you through any kind of challenge and the toughest of times.\n\nIf you really want to motivate yourself and stay motivated, you need a big enough “WHY”, because it is going to be tough, uncomfortable and painful, otherwise you might quit mid-way.\n\nOnce you have that big-enough reason, it will push you through any kind of adversity and you will succeed.\n\nIf you want to explore more about how to find your WHY, you can read this book “Find Your Why” by Simon Sinek.\nFollow Your Biggest Rituals“\n\nRituals define us. All the results in your life come from a standard. And then you follow the standard up with rituals.” ~Tony Robbins\n\nAs discussed earlier, motivation won’t take you far but a well-set system will.\n\nEstablishing certain rituals or habits into your life will ensure that you make progress on your goals and passion.\n\nBryan, CEO Founder of PhCreative, shares in his article on Inc.com how some of the world’s most successful people like Steve Jobs, Tony Robbins, Oprah kick start their day with amazing morning rituals.\n\nRituals prepare you not for the good times but for the tough times so that you stay strong and keep moving in the direction of your vision and dreams.\n\nAnybody can work in favorable circumstances, but when things go wrong, when the going gets tough, it is the power of your rituals which will push you through.\n\nThat’s the power of habit.\n\nBut how will you find out which habits to develop or rituals to start with?\n\nSo, I’m making this easier for you.\n\nHere’s a simple framework you can use to identify your rituals or success habits. It is from my Amazon Best Selling Book ‘Rewire for Massive Success’.\n\nIt is called P.M.P.\nP — Physical Fitness Ritual\n“Take care of your body. It’s the only place you have to live.” ~Jim Rohn\n\nYou need to take care of your physical well-being because this is the only asset you have. This is one of the main ingredient for your success. There are a lot of benefits of regular exercise.\n\nAny practice or activity which keeps you physically fit and active can be your physical fitness ritual. There could be a number of activities which you can choose from.\n\nTo name a few, these could be jogging, yoga, cycling, gym, playing sports, walking, rope skipping, etc.\n\nSelect an activity that suits you, your body, and your daily routine.\n\nDevote at least 30–45 Mins every single day for this ritual, either morning or evening, but do it religiously.\n\nIt will not only make you physically fit and energetic, but will also increase your productivity throughout the day.\n\nI won’t be explaining much as a lot of information is already available about it on the internet and various books.\n\nI read this one book and incorporated some of the tips which I found very effective. It’s “The Athlete in You” by Kinita Kadakia Patel, an award-winning sports nutritionist who works with leading sports teams, organizations, and schools.\n\nYou can also check out her blog for more information about how nutrition plays a crucial role in maintaining your overall fitness.\nM — Mental Fitness Ritual\n\n“The mind is just like a muscle — the more you exercise it, the stronger it gets and the more it can expand.” ~Idowu Koyenikan\n\nThis ritual is about keeping your mind relaxed and calm. It is as important as your physical fitness.\n\nBoth are interlinked. If you feel physically good, your state of mind will also become better and if you’re mentally relaxed, you will feel more energy in your body.\n\nIt is a balance between the two that you need to maintain.\n\nFor this, you don’t need to do something extraordinary. You just need to spend some time with your own self during the day. If you can do that in the morning, it will be great. I’ll share some of the activities which you can try. For this, devote at least 15–20 minutes.\n\n• Meditation\n\n• Mindfulness practice\n\n• Sitting quiet and introspect:\n\nAnd when you do this exercise, journal your experiences and whatever insights you get.\n\nI found this massive guide on how to practice mindfulness by S.J. Scott. If you want to learn more about Mindfulness Practice, you can check it out.\nP — Power Booster Ritual\n\nOr you can also call it your ‘Daily dose of motivation’.\n\nAs discussed earlier, that motivation doesn’t last long. Like you have to take your meals at regular intervals, similarly, take your dose of motivation.\n\nPower Booster Ritual is something which gives you an instant boost. It motivates you and fills you with the energy to take on anything. It is something that touches your heart, shakes you up a bit and re-energizes you to take action.\n\nWhat I used was a compilation of various talks.\n\nFor you, it could be your favorite talk, song, poem, motivational speech, some inspirational audio, story, etc.\n\nChoose such audio to which when you listen, it goes deep in your heart and gives you goosebumps.\n\nIt thrills you and gives you hope that you can do anything you wish to do.\n\nIt must be something that helps you throw away your fears and limiting beliefs. It must give you a positive mindset.\n\nIf you try to recall, you must have listened to at least one such audio which makes you feel this way.\n\nThat one song from your childhood memories which still brings a smile on your face no matter what kind of mess you are in.\n\nYou must have heard that one story which inspires you to the highest level.\n\nYou must have listened to at least one such speaker whose speech had touched your soul and you had said, ‘Wow!’\n\nWhy wait for such tools to motivate yourself by coincidence?\n\nWhy not use them to motivate yourself each day, so that you never run out of that amazing energy?\n\nThoughtfully select such audio and listen to it every single day.\n\nYou can listen to it while you are working out.\n\nOr listen to it while you travel.\n\nOr listen to it when you wake up.\n\nOr listen to it before you sleep.\n\nChoose a time and listen to it at least 2–3 times a day, initially. Within 1 month, you will see the magic happening.\n\n2. How To Boost Your Self Confidence To Get Through Daily Struggles Of Life?\nOnce you are able to identify your WHY and establish some kinds of rituals or habits into your life, it becomes relatively easier to stay motivated for your goals.\n\nIn your daily life, you will face many struggles which might lower your motivation level and you don’t wish to continue.\n\nIt happens with everyone. It happens with me too, till today.\n\nHow you can overcome that?\n\nIf you’ll ask me how do I overcome that on a daily basis, then…\n\nbelow are some of the practices I follow to reduce the impact of such distractions.\nDeclutter to Stay Laser Focused\n\n“Don’t ever let somebody tell you, you can’t do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can’t do somethin’ themselves, they wanna tell you, you can’t do it. If you want somethin’, go get it. Period.” ~Most famous quote from movie “The Pursuit of Happyness”\n\nThese distractions could be useless activities you do, toxic people in your life or your own limiting thoughts. Identify those distractions and remove them brutally. It will help you remain laser focused.\n\nRemoving such distractions from your life is the best way to stay focused and increase productivity.\n\nFor removing limiting thoughts and toxic people from your mind, you can do this activity.\n\n[Pro Stuff] Take out a piece of paper from your journal and write down: • All the fears, negative thoughts and situations that you have faced at some point or the other in your life and you had to struggle with them the most • Name of persons who always pull you down, stop you from moving forward and induce negative energy, no matter what you do -People who always thrust their opinions on you about what you can or cannot do -People who try to judge your capabilities and put labels on you Just write that down on a piece of paper, all of it. Take a couple of minutes to think and write it. Pick this paper in your hands, close your eyes and visualize all of that you have written in front of your eyes. Bring all the anger in you with which you would like to remove all those distractions out of your life. What would you want to do when you are super angry with someone?\n\nImagine slapping, punching, and shouting. With that level of anger, just tear down the paper into pieces. Tear it down into the tiniest of the pieces with all the anger and energy you have. Imagine kicking all that out of your life permanently. Phew! Done it? Great!\n\nHow are you feeling right now? Observe the change you have in your energy and willpower.\n\nAssimilate it. Let it percolate deep inside you. Keep this attitude to deal with such distractions in your life and protect your growth and dream.\n\nOther distractions you need to remove from your life are the activities which take away your precious time on a daily basis.\n\nFor removing such activities, you need to be aware of where you spend your time. At least at the end of the day, revisit your day and make a note of activities where you spent your time.\n\nAnd such distractions happen especially when you are including something new into your life.\n\nSuppose, you are installing a new habit to jog every day. What kind of distractions can prevent your change to be sustainable and how you can protect it?\n\nYou might have distractions from your friends, you might be abstaining from waking up early in the morning due to laziness or you might be sleeping late at night because you were busy watching TV series or movies on your laptop, or had spent a lot of time on social media checking out what your friends are up to. You might be taking a very heavy meal before you sleep.\n\nWhat are these?\n\nThese are nothing but the pests which will eat away the seed of change you want to sow in your life. Due to these pests, you won’t be able to continue your new habit to jog in the morning.\n\nThese distractions bring your motivation level down.\n\nThen most of the people quit.\n\nIf you really want your change to be permanent and fruitful, you need to identify such harmful elements and ruthlessly throw them away.\n\nThese distractions happen in a moment. You just have to take care of those moments. The action you take in that particular moment will either boost your energy or drain it further. So, just take the right action in that moment.\n>> When you think of hitting the snooze button in the morning to get that extra 15 minutes of sleep, choose to get up from the bed.\n\n>> When you feel the craving to blame someone else and feel good, then take the onus on yourself, take the responsibility and move forward.\n\n>> When you are tempted to check your smartphone to see how many likes or comments you have got on your recently uploaded pics, keep your phone away and focus on something more important.\n\n>> When your friend asks you to eat something which is not according to the diet you have chosen for yourself, say no.\n\n>> When someone ridicules your dreams and passion which lets you feel inferior about yourself, just ignore it and move on.\n\nThere can be a number of such moments in your daily life by which you get distracted, waste your time and energy, and move away from your path, which tends to eat away your seed of change.\n\nIt’s YOU who has to decide what to do at that moment because only you can do that. Only you have that power with you until you give that control to someone else.\nKeep the Entry Barrier Low\n\nStart small to build self-confidence, self-esteem and feel good about yourself.\n\nIt will not only help you to motivate yourself but also stay motivated every single day. There is magic in starting small.\n\nThe biggest mistake I did when I started working for my health and fitness, I expected too much.\n\nI planned that I would wake up at 5 am and work out for 1–2 hour.\n\nImagine a situation, when you have not done any such thing in the past and suddenly you plan to do it.\n\nWhat will happen?\n\nYou may or may not be able to do it. And when you fail, what happens?\n\nYou get demotivated and you stop doing it.\n\nBut when you keep your entry barrier very low, you start to make progress and build self-confidence gradually. So, keep it as low as possible and gradually increase the level.\n\nIt will help you to maintain continuity, motivation and your hunger for more.\n\nFor example: if you have to start a daily routine of exercise or gymming, start with a small 5–10 minutes of body stretches each day for 20–30 days.\n\nWhen you are able to continue that, increase the time and level of exercise you do.\n\nYou can apply this logic anywhere in your life and become better with time.\nProgress Each Day To Build Momentum\n\nConsistency is another crucial thing that you need to care about.\n\nMake progress every single day. No matter how small it is, it will help you become better each day.\n\nWhile working on my blog, it happens with me too, that on some day, I’m not able to do a lot of work due to various reasons.\n\nTherefore, I make sure that I do something every day, even if it is a very small task like searching for a new topic for future articles, sharing my article link to Facebook groups, writing a small piece, making some changes in my blog, updating my existing article, etc.\n\nGustavo Razzetti, CEO @ liberationist.org, explains the power of making progress every single day in his article on The Ten Percent Advantage: How to Make Progress Every Day.\n\nMaking progress every day helps me to stay connected and look at myself with confidence. It keeps me in the game and I feel motivated to do more.\n\nBut if you break that consistency, after some days you will lose interest and you will be more likely to quit.\n\nIf you are doing a full-time job, working on your passion with a job could be a daunting task and sometimes you will not feel like doing it.\n\nSometimes, you might have planned for a 3 hours slot to work on your passion but you are left with just one hour because you got late or you simply wasted your time in relaxing for too long or some useless activity.\n\nNow the choice is with you, either to waste that one hour you are left with by repenting on the two hours wasted or just get up and make some progress in that one hour.\n\nYou will come across such situations a many times, no matter whether you are working a full-time job, a student, a homemaker or a freelancer.\n\nWhenever it happens, you need to handle it wisely.\n\nRemember, some progress is always better than no progress at all. It helps in building momentum on a daily basis.\nLook Back And Remind Yourself Why You Started\n\nHere is how your biggest WHY helps you.\n\nWhenever you feel low on motivation and find yourself clueless, remind yourself of your biggest WHY for which you started in the very first place.\n\nThe bigger your why will be, the easier it will be for you to overcome such phases.\n\nEven I face such situations, then I revisit my biggest WHY and it pumps me up with new energy.\n3. How To Handle Failures And Setbacks To Bounce Back?\n\nMake Up Your Mind\n\nSetbacks or failures should not be surprises for you.\n\nWhen you start working on something, understand that you might face a failure too and that should not be a shock for you.\n\nMake up your mind how you are going to handle your setbacks so that when it comes, it is not a surprise for you and you know how to get through this.\n\nIt is not about making a Plan B or doubting your capabilities. Sometimes, there could be circumstances due to which you might fail. But you have to decide how you are going to respond to it.\n\nIt is about understanding that even if you fail, that will be an opportunity to learn. That is how you have to make up your mind.\nBe Gentle, Kind And Compassionate Towards Yourself\n\nThe first thing you do when you fail is to curse yourself. Please don’t do it.\n\nNobody makes an attempt to fail, everybody wants to succeed. And you too did it to succeed.\n\nIt’s fine if you failed. Be gentle to yourself. Show some compassion for yourself. Appreciate that you tried.\n\nTake this time to revisit and find what went wrong. Learn from it, improve it and give another attempt.\n4. How To Handle Success To Rise Even Higher?\nBe Grateful\n\nWhen you achieve success in whatever you are doing, be grateful to whatever you believe in.\n\nIt’s easy to get carried away and become arrogant but it won’t help you. Success must bring humility, not arrogance.\nSuccess Might Feel Different From How You Thought Of\n\nSometimes, success doesn’t feel the way you thought about it.\n\nWhen I wrote my book ‘Rewire for Massive Success’, I had put a lot of efforts to make it best selling book on Amazon. I thought when it will happen, I’ll be happy and it will be a great achievement.\n\nBut when my book finally became Amazon Best Seller after a continuous struggle of more than one year, the feeling wasn’t the same as I expected. I felt the rush for some time but then I felt clueless.\n\nFor a couple of months, I struggled and kept asking myself “So what?”, “What next?”\n\nIt took me some time to figure out what to do next. And then I came up with this blog ‘Selfhelpiness.com’ with a much bigger vision. I also developed a new concept of Selfhelpiness Quotient so that one can look beyond IQ and EQ. (Check out your SQ if you haven’t)\n\nSuccess comes with excitement and immediately leaves you in a dip if it is based on some external factor.\n\nIt’s like an amazing party night you had with friends and the next day you are in a hangover. Eventually, you will be successful in whatever you are doing but the more difficult part is when you get it, how to build on that.\n\nAnd you will not be able to do that unless you have your goals beyond materialistic things. Your goals, your passion must be intrinsic.\n\nThe more you are connected to your inside, the more stable you will be.\nSummary\n\nDon’t rely on motivation by chance. Use it like bathing or having your meals.\n\nPrepare a system or routine for yourself where it becomes your habit to stay motivated and consistently improve at whatever you are doing.\n\nDeclutter your mind and your life in order to save your time and energy, and even your money.\n\nStart small, make progress every single day and remind yourself your biggest WHY.\n\nLearn to handle failures as well as successes.\n\nBe kind to yourself, show some compassion and keep getting better at your craft. No matter how small is your progress, keep doing it.\nFreebies With This Guide\nA Small Request\n\nIf you found this guide on “How to motivate yourself and stay motivated?” useful, please share it with people who might need it.

Making progress every day helps me to stay connected and look at myself with confidence. Setting Up The Right Foundation For A Long Term Game\nUnleash The Biggest ‘WHY’“\n\nHe who has a WHY to live can bear almost any how.” ~Fredrick Nietzsche\n\nRemember a time, when you had to prepare for a job interview, you had a deadline to meet, or your loved one was in need. More than motivation, you need a system or routine in place that can ensure that you stay motivated and get things done which are important to you. No matter how small it is, it will help you become better each day. Whenever you feel low on motivation and find yourself clueless, remind yourself of your biggest WHY for which you started in the very first place. Anybody can work in favorable circumstances, but when things go wrong, when the going gets tough, it is the power of your rituals which will push you through. If you really want to motivate yourself and stay motivated, you need a big enough “WHY”, because it is going to be tough, uncomfortable and painful, otherwise you might quit mid-way. Make up your mind how you are going to handle your setbacks so that when it comes, it is not a surprise for you and you know how to get through this. While working on my blog, it happens with me too, that on some day, I’m not able to do a lot of work due to various reasons. If you try to recall, you must have listened to at least one such audio which makes you feel this way. But we rarely create a Big WHY for our daily routine and that’s the major reason why people search for motivation from the outside. If you can give the same sense of purpose to your daily life, believe me, you are set to do wonders. Learn how to find your purpose and passion in life, it will help you push through any kind of challenges. When you start working on something, understand that you might face a failure too and that should not be a shock for you. In your daily life, you will face many struggles which might lower your motivation level and you don’t wish to continue. If you are doing a full-time job, working on your passion with a job could be a daunting task and sometimes you will not feel like doing it. Other distractions you need to remove from your life are the activities which take away your precious time on a daily basis. Rituals prepare you not for the good times but for the tough times so that you stay strong and keep moving in the direction of your vision and dreams. There can be a number of such moments in your daily life by which you get distracted, waste your time and energy, and move away from your path, which tends to eat away your seed of change. It will help me to reach out to more people and bring some positive change in their life. Motivation doesn’t last and that’s why people ask “How to stay motivated?”\n\nMotivation is like a quick sugar rush. You just need to spend some time with your own self during the day. Eventually, you will be successful in whatever you are doing but the more difficult part is when you get it, how to build on that.",

        "description": "Whenever I talk to people about my passion, I get showered with questions like these:\n\nHow to find your purpose and passion in life?\n\nHow do I find my passion?\n\nHow to find what’s your calling?\n\nIs there a step by step guide to find your passion?\n\nIs there a test or quiz to find your passion?\n\nIs there a book about how to find your passion?\n\nHow to find your passion and make it your career?\n\nHow to find what you love to do?\n\nHow to find your calling?\n\n……..\n\n…..\n\n…\n\nAnd so on. Such questions are never ending! Everyone is so crazy about how to find your purpose and passion in life.\n\nI love public speaking, writing and helping others to become their better version. And this is not something that I got enlightened with one fine day.\n\nIt is something I have developed over a period of time by experimenting and exposing myself to new things in life.\n\nFinding my passion has been a wonderful journey and I’m still exploring and evolving.\nWhy You Should Find Your Purpose and Passion in Life?\n\nBefore you start your journey of how to find your purpose and passion in life, you must ask these questions to yourself:\n\nWhy should you find your passion?\n\nWhy is it important for you to find your passion?\n\nYou might think that it will make your life easier because you’ll no longer have to go to a job you hate.\n\nMost of the people think that if you know how to find your purpose and passion in life, it will make their life easier. But it’s seldom true.\n\nMost of the entrepreneurs end up working for more than 80 hours a week after leaving their 40 hours a week job. And the interesting thing is that they are happy to do that.\n\nSometimes that even takes a toll on their personal life, health, and relationships too. But they still do it.\n\nWHY?\n\nBecause…\n\nThey do it to make their life worthwhile and meaningful.\n\nThey are interested in creating a much bigger impact not just in their own life but for others too.\n\nPassion + Daily Action = Meaningful Life\n\nAnd if you’ll ask me if there is some perfect recipe for how to find your purpose and passion in life, the answer is a BIG NO!\n\nBut is it possible to find your passion or find what you love to do?\n\nThe answer is YES!\n\nBecause discovering your passion, is something which you will have to do all by yourself.\n\nWhen you choose to self-introspect and are open to experimentation with your life…\n\nWhen you are ready to do unconventional things and learn new skills…\n\n…there are greater chances that you will be able to find what you love to do.\n\nBut, if you will wait for a perfect time, for someone to reveal your passion to you…\n\n…I doubt if such a moment will ever come 🙂\n\nIf you ask me, I’ll share ways that worked for me and helped me to find my passion in life.\n\nAnd I’m glad that it can be turned into a profession (thought that’s a discussion for some other time).\n\nSo…\n1. Take a PAUSE to Reflect (P)\nThe biggest reason why you might not be able to find your passion or calling is that you are constantly busy with your routine life…\n\n…and never took a break to think for a moment from where you are coming and where you are heading in life.\n\nHave you?\n\nIf you look at your life, you’ll find that most of the time you are distracted due to various reasons…\n\n…sometimes it may be your phone, calls, emails, TV shows or stupid opinions of others.\n\nIf you really want to know how to find your purpose and passion in life, you’ll need to do something about it.\n\nThese distractions take away the most valuable thing you have, your focus and your time.\n\nYou think you are busy, but you are just distracted.\n\nYou spend your valuable time and focus on things which don’t add value to your life.\n\nSo, stop giving a f*ck about things that don’t matter, as Mark Manson tells in his book.\n\nIf you can take some time off from all of your daily distractions and spend some time with yourself…\n\n…you’ll be able to explore a whole new world for yourself\n\n…you’ll be able to find your passion,\n\n…you’ll be able to find your calling,\n\n…you’ll be able to find your purpose in life.\n\nSuggested Reading: The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*Ck\n\nIn order to take a pause to reflect on your life, you need to cut away all kinds of distractions at least once a day for at least 20–35 minutes.\n\nSwitch off your phone and any other thing that can take away your attention.\n\nIndulge in something that soothes you and shifts your awareness inward.\n\nYou can try activities like…\n\n    Mindfulness meditation\n    Take a walk in a nearby park\n    Observe nature\n\nWhen you take such pauses, observe your life from a third person perspective,\n\n…examine where you are, connect the dots from your past and see where you are headed,\n\n…observe what are your fundamental values and beliefs on which you operate.\n\nWhen you do this exercise on regular basis, you’ll have more clarity about yourself and you’ll be more SELF AWARE.\n\nClarity and Self Awareness are the basic ingredients to find your purpose and passion in life.\n\nWhile doing this activity, whatever comes to your mind, just write it down in your journal.\n\nOh! I forgot to ask. Do you have a JOURNAL??\n\nIf not, then you must have one. It will be a great tool for you on your journey of finding your purpose and passion.\n\n2. ASK Questions to Bring Clarity (A)\nTo find your purpose and passion in life, ask some questions to yourself which will help in bringing some clarity.\n\nYou can try it now.\n\nTake a moment and ask these simple questions to yourself, right now!\n\nGrab your journal (or a paper) and pen, write down your answers to these questions.\n\nWhere do you spend most of your time and money, especially on holidays?\n\nWhat kind of content do you consume in the form of videos, blogs, and books?\n\nWhat your friends reach out to you for, most of the time?\n\nWhat did you love to do when you were a kid?\n\nWhat makes you happy even if it is tough to do and you can even forget to eat?\n\nWhat would you do if money didn’t matter?\n\nWhat would you spend your time doing, if you had the complete financial abundance to do anything?\n\nDon’t be so selective about the answers, whatever comes to your mind, just write it down.\n\nI do this exercise whenever I find myself a bit lost.\n\nWhen I answered these questions for myself, I got insights like these:\n\nI spend most of my time reading books, blogs and watching videos on self-improvement, human behavior, and psychology.\n\nI spend money to buy books and online courses on similar topics. And my sweet wife always complains about it 😉\n\nI love to write about my experience and because of that, I was able to publish my book too. Fortunately, it became #1 Amazon Best- Selling Book in Coaching & Training category within a couple days of launch. This book has my journey of going through the toughest phase of my life and discovering my passion and purpose for life, my calling. You can check it out here. 🙂\n\nOver the years, I have realized that my friends use to ask me about how to deal with situations, people and their own mindsets. That’s what I have been doing since I was in college.\n\nAnd that’s what I love doing. Some people call it counseling and some call it coaching. But that’s something really excites me.\n\nAs a kid, I used to stand on my bed (using it as a stage) and speak as if I was delivering a speech in front of an audience.\n\nMy friends and family would sit around to listen to me.\n\nI don’t exactly remember what I used to speak, but it was fun and all of them used to enjoy it.\n\nBecause of that, I started participating in public speaking competitions at school and fortunately, won some accolades too 🙂\n\nWriting articles, interacting with people, conducting workshops, promoting my blog and spending quality time with my family, is what makes me really happy.\n\nAlthough I’m still doing a 9 to 5 job, even then I’m able to do so many additional things because it makes me happy and keeps me excited.\n\nSimilarly, you can reflect upon your life and find out answers to the above questions.\n\nThis will help in understanding how you can find your purpose and passion in life.\n3. REMEMBER, You are Mortal, to look at a Bigger Picture (R)\nRemember you are mortal and can be gone at any moment.\n\nSorry, for saying it. But it’s the universal truth.\n\nThis might be intimidating but it’s true.\n\nYou might love to plan your entire life as if you are going to live forever but that’s not the case.\n\nThe sooner you realize it, the better you will be.\n\nThis life is very fragile and we don’t know when we are gone forever.\n\nPeople think too much, hold grudges, plan everything meticulously, accumulate so many things, believing they are not going to die.\n\nThis human body has an expiry date too.\n\nTherefore, whatever life You and I are left with, must be spent to make it meaningful and joyful.\n\nTry to look at the bigger picture of your life\n\nIf you can look at the bigger picture, you’ll understand why it is important to find your purpose, your passion, your calling in life.\n\nIt is very easy to get carried away with your emotions or situations and make bad decisions in life.\n\nIf you are in confusion about something right now…\n\n…fast forward your life 30–40 years and see if it still matters to you. Then decide what you need to do.\n\nTherefore, try to add more and more experience to your life. Make it blissful.\n\nGet as much as exposure as possible.\n\nAnd how can you do that?\n\nThe best way is to Read and Interact as much as you can.\n\n    Invest time in reading stuff related to your interest and explore.\n    Read blogs, books, autobiographies, magazines…\n    Meet new people who have similar interest. Go to meetups and clubs like Toastmasters.\n    Talk to them. Understand how they look at things and how they work on their passion.\n    You don’t need to copy them, just imbibe the good practices they follow.\n\nIt will give you an opportunity to widen your horizon of thinking, it will give you more perspective and new angles to look at the same situation.\n\nIt will give you exposure and open doors to new possibilities.\n\nAnd you will understand that the world is much bigger than what you had thought.\n\nYour adversities, challenges, and struggles will start to look smaller.\n\nAnd the first thing you can do to make your life meaningful is by fueling your curiosity about how to find your purpose and passion in life.\n4. FEEDBACK from Friends to Discover Your Natural Talents (F)\nOff recently, I was doing this online course on “Personal Branding Mastery” on Udemy.\n\nDuring that course, I had to do one exercise. Initially, I was reluctant because it pushed me to become a bit vulnerable to accepting feedback.\n\nI didn’t know what people were going to tell about me.\n\nThe exercise had some questions which I had to ask my friends and colleagues in order to know what my skills and qualities are, from their perspective.\n\nAlso, get feedback on areas I need to make an improvement.\n\nBut when I did this exercise…\n\nI got some incredible insights that I never thought about myself. That proved really helpful and I’m thankful to people who took out time to respond to the questionnaire.\nAnd once you are through this exercise, let me know how do you feel after getting responses 🙂\n\nIt’s exciting and an eye-opener too.\n\nBased on the exercise, you will be able to uncover some of the qualities and skills which can shape your passion.\n\nThat will help you have some clues about how to find your purpose and passion in life.\n\n5. ACT & Experiment to Find Your Passion (A)\nAct, experiment and correct the course as you move ahead.\n\nPassion is not something that you’ll realize about it in your dreams and the next day you start working on it.\n\nPassion is developed and evolved over a period of time. You experiment with several things and evaluate your experience.\n\nYou might find yourself changing from one interest to another over time. And that’s completely fine.\n\nDon’t presume that your passion should be your job or you’ll have to quit your job to find your passion. That’s not true.\n\nFinding passion is not always about getting into a profession you love. Passion is spending your time doing something which is close to your heart.\n\nIt may become your profession or something which you do by taking out time apart from your profession.\n\nBut the crux is, you’ll have to act and be ready to experiment with things you do in your life.\n\nExperimentation is one of the best ways to find your purpose and passion in life.\n\nYour passion will not come to you just by sitting on the couch, sipping drinks and watching Netflix.\n\nYou will have to spend some time every single day to explore new things and experiment.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n    If you think traveling is something that excites you, then you’ll have to start researching about a place and pick up your backpack to travel on this coming weekend\n    If you think cooking re-energizes you, get into the kitchen and start preparing your unique recipe\n    If you think playing football is great, then stop watching a football game on TV, call up your friends and plan a match on this coming weekend\n    If you think writing is your passion, pick up a question you would like to answer and start writing about it right away\n    If you think playing Guitar is really awesome, then stop dreaming about it. Find the nearest music classes, call up, enroll and start attending classes from this week\n    If you think dancing is something very close to your heart, then find the nearest dancing classes or club and join it right away\n    If you want to explore something new, list down good books on that topic and start reading them one by one. List down names of people who have knowledge in that area and start meeting them one by one\n\nThere could be ’n’ number of such examples but the core message is the same.\n\nStop just dreaming.\n\nStop asking for secrets of how to find your purpose and passion in life 🙂\n\nAct right now and take the next step.\n\nBy doing this, will you find your passion?\n\nMaybe, Yes!. Maybe, No!\n\nBUT!\n\nYou’ll be at least one step closer to finding your passion.\n\nTaking such steps will make you a Doer.\n\nYou’ll no longer stay entangled in your thoughts.\n\nEven if you don’t find happiness in doing what you thought could be your passion, you’ll at least come to know that it’s not your passion.\n\nOtherwise, you would have kept on dreaming your entire life or maybe regretting that you never tried.\n\nTake actions even if they are small.\n\nLet your passion evolve with time.\n\nGive it some time.\n\nLet it grow like a baby. Don’t rush.\n\nAs Gary Vee says,\n\n“Micro speed and macro patience”\n\nBe fast in taking actions in your day to day life, however, keep immense patience over how you do in your entire life.\n\nEnjoy the journey of discovering your purpose and passion in life.\n6. Find Your STORY You Want to Tell the World (S)\nTo conclude what we have discussed so far, you may choose whatever you wish to do.\n\nBut always remember what story you want to tell the world.\n\nImagine Yourself as the Protagonist and Your Life as a Story. Decide what you want to convey.\n\nWhat kind of qualities do you want to express in this world?\n\nHow do you want yourself to be known or be identified by others? (This is not about getting influenced by others’ views but rather what kind of image YOU want to build)\n\nBe brave and bold about it.\n\nTell me, what kind of a story do you appreciate?\n\nA story where everything is easy and predictable…\n\nOr a story that is difficult to predict, where the hero has to struggle, face challenges and emerge as a winner at the end?\n\nObviously, the second one.\n\nBut when it comes to your own story, you wish it to be like the first one.\n\nThat’s not fair 🙂\n\nSo, stop worrying.\n\nLook at your life as a great story in making and work for it every day.\n\nBelieve me, your life will be more fun, worthwhile and valuable not just for you but others too.\nAnd whenever you wonder again about how to find your purpose and passion in life…\nRemember this acronym: P.A.R.F.A.S.",
        "summary": "But, if you will wait for a perfect time, for someone to reveal your passion to you…\n\n…I doubt if such a moment will ever come 🙂\n\nIf you ask me, I’ll share ways that worked for me and helped me to find my passion in life.

Before you start your journey of how to find your purpose and passion in life, you must ask these questions to yourself:\n\nWhy should you find your passion? Even if you don’t find happiness in doing what you thought could be your passion, you’ll at least come to know that it’s not your passion. Try to look at the bigger picture of your life\n\nIf you can look at the bigger picture, you’ll understand why it is important to find your purpose, your passion, your calling in life. Whenever I talk to people about my passion, I get showered with questions like these:\n\nHow to find your purpose and passion in life?

You might think that it will make your life easier because you’ll no longer have to go to a job you hate.

        "title": "How to Have Life-Changing Insights Whenever You Want",
        "description": "The human mind is basically a giant network.\n\nIn our minds, we know individual things. These are the nodes of our network. Then, we connect each thing we know to an uncountable amount of other things we know. Each node has thousands of connections to other nodes, forming millions of connections. All of these nodes, and the connections between them, form a network of all the things we know — our knowledge network.\n\nIf you’ve ever let your mind wander, moving from one thought to the next in an idle way, you’ve taken a joyride down your own knowledge network.\n\nMost of the time, our knowledge network grows organically. New growth paths emerge along the edge, causing it to grow a little every day.\n\nAs we learn more about different subjects, clusters of knowledge begin to form. All the things we know about a topic, like “living in an RV,” form their own cluster. All the things we know about software engineering form another.\n\nThen, our minds link related knowledge clusters together. “RV living” and “minimalism” are related to each other, so there are a lot of connections between them. “RV living” and “software engineering” don’t have much to do with each other, though, so they don’t have many connections. If you were to let your mind wander, it would stop at many stops between RV living and software engineering.\nInsights are new connections between clusters.\n\nAn insight isn’t just any old new connection.\n\nAn insight is a new connection between two clusters that previously didn’t have anything to do with each other.\n\nThis single connection acts as a bridge, allowing dozens more to form in its wake. This instant formation of hundreds of new connections produces the heady rush of understanding accompanying an insight.\n\nMost people think they can’t do anything to trigger insight. They think epiphanies just come out of the clear blue sky. As a result, they don’t experience insight often.\n\nBut flashes of insight are not out of your control. You don’t have to wait for them to come to you. You can teach your mind to make these connections far more often.\n\nThere’s only one thing you have to do.\nRead more books — and read them right.\n\nEvery book is its own cluster of information. Each chapter, paragraph, and sentence is a new node of information.\n\nAs you read more books, you form more clusters of information. As you form more clusters of knowledge, you create more opportunities for clusters and nodes to link together.\n\nBut you have to be careful. You can’t just read books any old way. You have to read them carefully and take in what they say.\n\nStorytime: In a past life, I was very Christian. I was a well-educated one, too; not only did I read Christian classics like C.S. Lewis and Lee Strobel, I also read books by dead guys like Saint Augustine.\n\nNot wanting to be accused of a shallow understanding of the world, I also made a point of reading atheist works like those by The Four Horsemen of Atheism.\n\nBut none of these books, atheist or Christian, expanded my worldview even one iota.\n\nWhy? Because I read them with an agenda.\n\n    When I read pro-Christian books, I didn’t question them. When they made a pretty-sounding argument, I accepted it uncritically.\n    When I read anti-Christian books, I immediately engaged every intellectual faculty I have in refuting them.\n\nIt took me a shamefully long time to realize most people regard highly that which confirms their biases and shy away from that which does not.\n\nSo, while I may have read every book discussing Christianity that came out from 2000 to 2015, I might as well not have read any, because all they did was add to my cluster called “Christianity is right and atheism is wrong.”\n\nYou can only learn from books and form new connections if you’re reading to learn. Reading for fun, reading for specific research, and reading to satisfy an agenda all cause you to filter more information. You have fewer insights as a result.\nStart reading now, because insights take time.\n\nIt takes time reading for conceptual networks of information to start forming in your head. A lot of time.\n\nLast year, I read 82 books, and I didn’t begin to regularly feel the now-familiar rush of understanding until book 60. Now, after 120 books, I feel that rush of understanding several times per book.\n\nA larger network of information means each book can make more connections within my knowledge network. Concepts that would have wowed me at book thirty now seem to be only a small part of a much larger picture.\n\nThe big ideas haven’t gotten any smaller, but like overlooking a city from a cliff, I now have a much better vantage point.\n\nWhen I recall my life before reading, it was like I was stumbling around, drunk and blind. Thanks to books (lots and lots of books), my eyes are starting to open.\nWant More Great Articles?\n\nIf you want to read more thought-provoking articles like this one, my weekly digest is just the thing for you.",

        "title": "How to Avoid Mediocrity and Redefine Your Life",
        "description": "In 1960, five young men found themselves outside the imposing gates of St. Hugh’s Charterhouse, Parkminster, located in West Sussex, England. Their backgrounds were different, but they shared the same goal: to live alone with God.\n\nEach of these young men had chosen St. Hugh’s Charterhouse, which was home to one of the Western world’s most austere monastic orders, known as the Carthusians. Some of these young men came from other monastic orders. All were seeking a deeply ascetic life to focus on their relationship with God.\n\n    “There’s a difference between solitude and loneliness. I can understand the concept of being a monk for a while.” -Tom Hanks\n\nIf Navy SEALS are the toughest members of the United States military, then Carthusian monks are the Navy SEALS of the Catholic church. Unlike other monastic orders, Carthusians live their lives almost entirely alone in “cells.”\n\nTheir food is brought to them in lunch pales called “gamelles” and placed in a small wooden box. Carthusian monks wear itchy “hair shirts” beneath their white robes. They sleep in straw beds and are only allowed one hot bath per week.\n\nCarthusians follow a strict routine of prayers in their cells and daily “offices” in church, including midnight masses. As a result, their sleep cycles are broken. When not praying, they are studying, tending their individual gardens, or working in various jobs on the monastery grounds.\n\nEach Carthusian novice endures years of probation before their superiors vote on whether or not to allow them to become “professed solemns,” which binds them to the Carthusian community for life.\nAn infinity of little hours\n\nAuthor Nancy Klein Maguire chronicled the monastic journey of those five young men who joined the Carthusian order in 1960. Her book, “An Infinity of Little Hours,” grants us a rare glimpse inside this austere, highly disciplined monastic world.\nOnly one of the five young men went on to become a “professed solemn.” The other four lasted five years before leaving the order. Nancy Maguire married one of the four men who left, which is why she was able to gain special insight and access to the Carthusians.\n\nThere are Carthusian nuns as well, and their monastic lives closely mirror that of the monks. Like the monks, they live in cells, eat no meat, fast weekly, and follow a strict schedule of religious “offices”, which includes midnight masses.\n\nWhy we might ask, would anyone willingly choose to live such a cloistered life of self-denial, sacrifice, discipline, and endless contemplation? For Carthusian monks and nuns, they’ll tell you it’s a calling from God.\n\n    “Love is not a feeling of happiness. Love is a willingness to sacrifice.” -Michael Novak\n\nTheir calling, however, is deeply tested. Consider the process of entry, as quoted directly from the Carthusian website:\n\n    “Upon his entering the monastery, the candidate begins his postulancy which lasts from three months to a year. If, at that point, his vocation is confirmed, he’ll take the Carthusian habit and begin his novitiate for a period of two years. Following the novitiate come temporary vows for three years, which are then renewed for two years. Solemn vows takes place at the end of those two years, at which time the monk gives himself to the life in front of God and Church forever.”\n\nMen and women drawn to the monastic life are seeking a more intimate relationship with God. Wealth, power, fame, sex, possessions, and consumption have no hold on these individuals. They have transcended the usual human desires, in search of the divine.\nWhat you were put on earth to do\n\nMy calling in life has always been drawing and writing. My best friend as a boy was my sketchbook. But I didn’t pursue art as a career. My parents worried it would be hard for me to make a living as an artist or writer, so I became a police officer.\n\nA lot of people deny their true calling for the sake of practicality or pragmatism. In my case, things worked out. I became police chief, enjoyed a successful career, and gained a lot of wisdom about people and life.\nThe only problem was that I was always conflicted. Always struggling to carve out time for my artwork. Eventually, I gave in to the muse. I retired five years early, sacrificing a larger pension, to become a full-time writer and artist.\n\n    “Your profession is not what brings home your paycheck. Your profession is what you were put on earth to do. With such passion and such intensity that it becomes spiritual in calling.” — Virgil\n\nSome of the Carthusian monks I read about were successful and established professionals. They had money and prestige, yet they walked away from it all to pursue an austere life of contemplation.\n\nWhether you are a person of faith or not, there is much we can learn from these modern-day ascetics. Especially in this time of world-wide pandemic, when society has shut down and everyone is isolated at home.\n\nIf your life feels like an endless cycle of mediocrity, maybe some monk inspired wisdom will help you redefine your life? To that end, here are some suggestions.\nDefine your purpose\n\nWhat do you think your life should be about? Why were you put here on this earth? These are not easy questions, and they require a good deal of contemplation.\nCarthusian aspirants spend years as probationary monks, to make sure they are certain about their life’s purpose.\n\nOften, the beliefs we carry and the careers we pursue are a reflection of our upbringing and the influence of our parents. The question is, do these things define who we are, or hope to be?\n\nDefining your purpose means thinking about the things that are important to you. For most, our families come first. Loving, caring, and providing for our families is part of our purpose, but not all.\n\nI figured out that, beyond my family, creative expression was my highest purpose. And so after many years, I have finally crafted a life around my artwork and writing.\n\nOur highest purpose and how we make a living are often not the same thing. Most people have to juggle the two, but the more we can devote to our highest purpose, the happier we tend to be.\nTake ownership of your schedule\n\nIt’s the tyranny of endless interruptions and poor time management that lead to mediocrity in our lives.\n\nCarthusian monks follow a disciplined daily routine. When the bells chime, the monks are in church. In their cells, they have set times for reading, prayer, gardening, and work. Nothing is allowed to interrupt their routine.\n\nHow are you doing with your schedule? Do you allow others to spend your time for you? Have you learned how to politely say no to discretionary commitments that don’t align with your highest purpose?\n\nThere will always be some priorities for your schedule, namely, quality time with family. But how you choose to spend the rest of your time, and those little hours, matters.\nUnplug\n\nCarthusian monks don’t have televisions, smartphones, and radios. A few have limited access to the Internet, mostly to handle business transactions in support of their monastery.\n\nCarthusian monks unplug from the noise of modernity to get closer to spiritual eternity. There’s a lesson in this for the rest of us.\n\nHow often do we check our smart phones for emails, texts, stats, and social media updates? Is this time well spent, or have we become like Pavlov’s dogs, conditioned to respond to stimuli? Addicted to the next tweet or Facebook update.\n\nWhat if we chose to unplug more? What if we became reacquainted with the joys of silence, solitude, and peaceful contemplation? Imagine how much that would calm our nerves and minds.\nTend your garden\n\nAdjacent to each Carthusian monk’s cell is his garden, where he can pray, contemplate, and grow flowers and vegetables. Most gardeners will tell you that there is a kind of serenity and peace that washes over them when in the garden.\nThis special serenity and peace can be found in any creative passion or activity that feeds our soul. When I’m painting a landscape or drawing an elaborate illustration, I lose track of time. I become immersed in the moment. Some people call this flow.\n\nRemember to tend your garden, whatever passion that may mean for you.\nTo choose one’s own way\n\nWe are not sentenced to one kind of life. As the Austrian neurologist and Holocaust survivor, Viktor Frankl wrote in his seminal book, “Man’s Search for Meaning:”\n\n    “Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”\n\nOver this last year of pandemic isolation, I’ve pretended to be a sort of amateur monk. I defined my purpose to be a writer and artist. I took ownership of my schedule by avoiding unnecessary commitments. I unplug by limiting social media and television. I stick to my “cell” (art studio) and tend to my garden (writing and drawing.)\n\nI’ve learned that the magic happens in the “little hours” of life. That early morning cup of coffee in the stillness of your garden. That tranquil, afternoon walk with your dogs.\nSeek these moments of stillness in your life, and you’ll experience inner peace.\n\nYou don’t have to live a hectic, chaotic life. Yes, there may be periods when life is hard, but often we have more choices than we realize.\n\nI sacrificed a larger police pension to redefine myself as a full-time writer and artist. I relocated to a more affordable area, simplified my life, and have created more space for the little hours.\n\nTake the time to figure out what your purpose is. With some quiet contemplation and effort, you can redefine your life. Mix in some of the Carthusian wisdom listed above, and soon you’ll be experiencing more of those little hours of joy.\n\n(Originally published at JohnPWeiss.com)",

        "title": "How Learning to Trust Myself Transformed My Love Life",
        "description": "I looked at the waterslide from afar with excitement.\r\n\r\nI liked the idea of it but not so much going on it. It was the summer I turned thirteen. Every year, as a big family, we went to the aqua park together. My parents, relatives, siblings, and me. I was scared of the height of the slide and how it spiraled down into an adult-deep pool. At the same time, everyone in my family was queuing for their turns, and I didn’t want to be left out.\r\n\r\nNoticing my hesitation, my aunt offered to accompany me. She said she would be right there if anything was to happen, and I would be safe. After contemplation, I agreed to join her.\r\n\r\nWe shared an inflatable float with double seats. My aunt was at the front, and I was right behind her. As the float was pushed down the slide, my heart started beating fast. I was consumed by the fear that the float would flip over, and I would fall. I didn’t know how to swim, and I was terrified of being thrown into the water and unable to breathe. Yet, it was exactly what was waiting for me.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we arrived at the end of the slide, my aunt let go of the float, ready for an exhilarating plunge, while I was left on my own, losing balance and falling straight into the water.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t take long for someone to notice and save me, but that one struggling moment when I was closer to death than to life was long enough to signal to my brain, “Stay the hell away from the water.”\r\n\r\nI ended up never learning to swim throughout my teenage years, even though my hometown was a coastal city and my family took me to the beach often. After other negative experiences, I developed anxiety around water, and, unknowingly, this anxiety bled into the other areas of my life. I could never trust that I was safe unless I was holding onto something.\r\n\r\nThat something, later in life, was a romantic relationship.\r\nLooking for Something to Hold onto\r\n\r\nMy father was absent for most of my childhood. When I turned seventeen, I left home to pursue an education in another country, so the chance of connecting with him became non-existent. My mother was around, but she wasn’t one to have deep emotional conversations with.\r\n\r\nAs a result, I never picked up a habit of coming to my parents for support. I always felt like I was alone.\r\n\r\nFor the first two years in London, I used my academic achievements as the lifeboat. I identified myself as hardworking and smart and held onto these labels to carry myself forward.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I failed to get into the same university as my successful sister and our paths diverged, I became demotivated and lost my grip on life.\r\n\r\nAcademic achievements were no longer important and enough to give me the security I needed. I felt like I was on a waterslide again, but I wasn’t ready for any plunge. I was already drowning in fear.\r\n\r\nThe thing with having no guidance and a lot of freedom is that you go about meeting your needs all wrong. You don’t know what your needs are — you just do whatever is easy and convenient to make yourself feel better.\r\n\r\nAnd, for a while, it’s all good. Your life is fun and exciting, and you think you’ve served yourself well. But, deep down, you’re hollow. You don’t understand what you’re doing. You bandaid the symptoms of your problems while the actual cause is killing you from the inside like cancer.\r\n\r\nI was aware of this “cancer”, but I didn’t know what to do about it. I couldn’t even pause for a second to think about my true needs because I was too busy silencing my anxiety — the anxiety stemming from missing an attachment, without which I wouldn’t know how to regulate myself.\r\n\r\nSo I spent my early twenties jumping from one dating situation to another, distracting myself from my problems with alcohol and mindless nights out. I chose the people who either resembled my father or had the qualities I wanted for myself. I used those relationships to fill myself up. I needed to be with those people to feel safe and okay.\r\n\r\nThey were the shiny inflatable floats that I grabbed out of hardwired habits and hoped would save me, even though every damn time, they would flip over and make me drown pathetically.\r\n\r\nWell, I should’ve known those relationships would fall apart as fast as they happened.\r\n\r\nThe breaking point was when I got involved with someone who called himself a psychopath. Luckily, I was never with him long enough to confirm that statement, but knowing him — for however brief it might have been — was the most depressing episode of my life.\r\n\r\nHe was a selfish person who had serious deficits of empathy and emotional depth. My prolonged situation with him, as a result, forced me to treat myself terribly and amplified every insecurity and fear I had. In the end, it left me little choice but to face my demons and ask millions of “why.”\r\n\r\nIn short, accepting him was denying myself. Interacting with him was abusing myself. And detaching from him was freeing myself and reclaiming my life.\r\n\r\nIt took me many lifestyle changes and several months of therapy to learn to recognise my true needs and meet them differently, including my need for emotional safety.\r\nLearning to Trust Myself\r\n\r\nShortly before my 25th birthday, I signed up for a swimming course.\r\n\r\nI had pinned a picture of a woman swimmer on my vision board a month earlier when I decided that I would turn my life around. No more ‘bandaids,’ no more ‘emotional floats’. My relationship with the ‘psychopath’ might have pushed me off the Great Trango into a deep sea, and it might have scared the life out of me, but I refused to sink — figuratively or literally.\r\nLearning to swim made me realise that I had never trusted myself.\r\n\r\nLooking back, when a relationship ended, I always struggled to let go, no matter how unhappy I had been with the ex-partner.\r\n\r\nWhen holding on was too painful and I had to cut off contact, I was paralysed by anxiety and panic attacks. I felt like my existence was being dismantled, and something horrific — no less than death — would happen to me. On my own, everything became a blur. And, suddenly, my future vanished.\r\n\r\nSo, when I let go of the real floats at my weekly swimming class and submerged my body comfortably in water, I learned to trust that I would be okay, and I didn’t need anyone to actively save me — or save me at all for that matter.\r\n\r\nWith therapy and other positive changes, I learned to calm myself down and rely on myself for support. I learned to sit with uncomfortable feelings, release control, and get attached to my own life.\r\n\r\nThe transformation was profound to me. You could even say it was magical.\r\n\r\nLearning to be okay on my own was the only way I could walk away from toxic relationships for good. I didn’t need those people to meet my needs anymore — I knew what my needs were, and I could meet them in a way that didn’t leave me feeling disrespected and traumatised all the time.\r\n\r\nAs I became self-reliant and securely attached, I was able to be a better friend and family member whom my beloved could rely on and show their vulnerability to, without having to worry that it would burden me.\r\n\r\nMost amazingly, I would never have to settle ever again because the alternative of having a relationship is being with me, and it sounds absolutely fantastic.\r\nThe Best Gift of Life\r\n\r\nA few months ago, I went swimming in an indoor pool with my current partner. Even though I took the swimming course, I didn’t manage to finish it all the way through, so my swimming ability was extremely limited. To manage my partner’s expectations, I told him I was rubbish.\r\n\r\nWhen he found out that I could float easily and move around in the water without struggling, he was impressed. He noted that I wasn’t scared of water anymore — it made me feel proud. I trusted myself, and I trusted him when he held my body horizontally, trying to teach me the correct movements.\r\n\r\nLearning to swim didn’t just gain me a valuable life skill; it formed part of the foundation that enabled me to provide emotional safety for myself and find an empathetic partner who could do the same for me — and so much more.\r\n\r\nI’m in a healthy and happy committed relationship now. I have love and support all around me from my friends and family. I can jump in the water with a smile on my face. I’m free to enjoy life as a secure and stable person.\r\n\r\nTo me, it’s the best gift of life, and it makes me think, maybe, life’s not so unfair after all.",

        "description": "By confidence, I don’t mean the ability to project confidence. And I’m not talking about trying to build confidence through positive thinking. I’m talking about real confidence. A better term would be inner peace.\n\nWithout inner peace, we don’t possess real confidence — we’re only acting confident, as a way of masking our insecurities. When we think of confidence we tend to think of someone who doesn’t have insecurities, but the truth is we all have insecurities. We cannot have real confidence until we are willing to admit to ourselves that those insecurities exist.\n\nConfidence is not about winning battles over our insecurities ie; ignoring them, pretending they don’t exist, doing macho things in order to silence them or to show others how fearless we are.\n\nEven confidence obtained through skill is fleeting. We can become very confident in our abilities at work, in sports, etc., but this doesn’t necessarily carryover into all other parts of life and we might still lack inner peace. We can all think of highly skilled people who are great at what they do and who are very confident in their abilities, but struggle with confidence in other parts of their life.\n\nConfidence can certainly be built through skill and experience, but it is not transcendent. That type of confidence is dependent on familiarity with a particular activity or environment. We can certainly find things that can give us a feeling of confidence and security, but these things can do nothing for us if they are taken away or not available to us.\n\nReal confidence has to be found within. There are resources that can aid us in finding that inner confidence (hopefully my words help), but ultimately each of us has to turn within and make peace with ourselves and with God.",

What we do with this hour and that one is what we are doing.”\n\nAnnie Dillard said that in her book The Writing Life. It’s an insightful statement that has a deeper meaning.

If you know how you’re spending your time, you can take ownership of your life and do more great work.\n\nIf you want to get better at managing your time, you have to know how you’re spending it. You can track your daily activities to clearly see where your time is being spent. Meetings, phone calls, emails, notifications, small chats, and many other distractions are constantly splitting our attention.\n\nYou can begin to analyse the actual time you spend on each activity with what you think is the best amount for each task and get to know what’s going on every day. Notice where time leaks, then declutter your routine.\n\nAfter interviewing dozens of successful, happy people, Laura Vanderkam, author of 168 Hours: You Have More Time Than You Think realized that they allocate their time differently than most of us.\n\nYou can choose how to spend your 168 hours. You have to be very protective of your time and what you do on your time or else people will walk all over it.\nBecome proactive, not reactive\n\n    “You will never find time for anything. If you want time, you must make it.”― Charles Buxton\n\nThe first step to reclaiming more time from your day is to get hold of the big chunks that aren’t being put to good use.\n\nYou are probably spending most of your productive time in reactive mode. Many people are constantly responding to emails, sitting in pointless meetings and dealing with other people’s “emergencies.”\n\nWhat are your personal goals? Are your daily activities and tasks advancing you closer to your life’s ultimate goal?\n\nWhich activities get you the most results? Focus on those and cut the waste.\n\nFrequently purge the items on your to-do list that won’t deliver results.\n\nBy managing your time as you would a small business, you can cut the excess and focus on what you really find most rewarding.\nReduce your commitments\n\n    “You can have it all. Just not all at once.”― Oprah Winfrey\n\nHow you choose to spend your time defines your priorities.\n\nYour commitments can have a significant impact on your time. Take a look at each area of your life and write down all of your commitments.\n\nSeeing it all written down can be quite an eye-opening experience, as well as overwhelming.\n\nWhile there are some commitments we can’t escape, such as work and family, others we can.\n\nYou have the right to allocate your own time.\n\nBegin to cut back on the time you spend helping others get their tasks done and start focusing on what you can do to help you reach your goals faster.\n\nLearn how to say no and decline offers. Accept to work on projects that bring out the best in you and enhance your total well-being.\n\nDon’t feel guilty. If you don’t like the way you spend your time, simply change it. Life is too short to work on anything you hate and everything that takes away your precious time.\n\nIf you eliminate the things that don’t bring you joy or value, you’ll have more time for the things that you love.\nMake the most of your gap time\n\n    “A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.”― Charles Darwin\n\nAfter 90 minutes of meetings, working, thinking, and pushing emails, your will to work will be in a bad place. Take a productive break.\n\nPut your gap time to good use.\n\nAnywhere from 1–3 hours of your day is probably spent in “gap time.”\n\nGap times are those between meaningful activities but aren’t normally long enough to get more done. Or the time you need to recover from deep work.\n\nSmall and long breaks from work and everything you do when you are not actively working on your tasks for the day can be put to better use.\n\nMost breaks either pull you down a rabbit hole of distraction or they make it difficult to return your full focus to work after the break.\n\nYou can listen to a podcast, learn a language, take a walk to think, read a book, read the articles you’ve bookmarked, plan the rest of your day, or better still take a productive pause to clear your mind.\n\nYou should be as strategic about your breaks as you are about your day in general. It’s critical to make the most of your break and remind yourself that by taking a productive pause, you will accomplish more in the long run.\n\nMost people accomplish more in short bursts with breaks in between, so organizing your schedule around these natural energy peaks will help you be more productive.\nBeware of “time bullies”\n\n    The key is in not spending time, but in investing it. — Stephen R. Covey.\n\nThese are the people that invade your time and try to get you to do reactive work. It’s the client that interrupts your vacation with frequency calls or emails. And the colleague at work who needs helps all the time.\n\nIt has become expected, even acceptable, for people to steal your time.\n\nDon’t let these bullies push you around.\n\nIf you do not protect your calendar, then others will abuse it.\n\nWhen you’re on the clock that’s your time for your work. But when it’s your lunch hour, you’re off-the-clock. Remember, that that time is YOURS.\n\nThere is a simple way to prevent this from happening. Learn how to say “no” when you’re busy.\n\nBe protective of your greatest asset.\n\nJust like any investor, put your time to good use. Don’t apologize for choosing to invest wisely.\nCut back on push notifications\n\n    “There’s never enough time to do all the nothing you want.”― Bill Watterson\n\nPush notifications are ruining our concentration and attention skills. They are literally distracting us from everything important to us. You don’t even have to read those messages for your mental gears to toggle off what you are focusing on.\n\nA Deloitte study in 2016 found that people look at their phones 47 times a day on average. Kill your notifications. Yes, really. Turn them all off.\n\nSmartphones aren’t your problem. It’s all the buzzing and dinging, endlessly calling for your attention.\n\nThe start-stop process on projects in killing your productivity. Push notification is your greatest enemy.\n\nDecide ahead of time how to spend your time. Block and tackle your key priorities. Schedule them in your calendar. Ignore email. Shut your office door. Turn off notifications on your phone. And get what matters most done.\n\nIt’s time to fight distractions. Create an uninterrupted, free-flowing, idea-generating, peaceful space to get work done on time.\nPlan tomorrow today\n\n    “The future starts today, not tomorrow.”― Pope John Paul II\n\nHaving a routine of what you will accomplish each day will give you a sense of order and make your life feel less chaotic, saving you the time for planning in the morning.\n\nInvesting less than 1% of your time today will make you 10 times more efficient tomorrow. Jack Canfield, says if you’d rather spend your day acting than reacting, you should plan it the night before.\n\nIf you have planned your week, or months ahead of time, you know what you will work on tomorrow. Remind yourself.\n\nSpend time planning your next day’s tasks the night before. For every minute you plan, you save minutes in execution. Spend your last 20 minutes every day to reflect, process, and prioritize for the next day. End your day on purpose.\n\nFiguring out the most imperative tasks for tomorrow and scheduling them into a “model day” is one of the best ways to organize your day for maximum results.\n\nYour plan will guide you when distracted and, in the late hours of the day when your willpower is low and it’s difficult to think, the same plan will help you focus on your most important tasks for the day.\n\nTaking 10 minutes or less today to create a plan for tomorrow will give you a head start, keep you on task, boost your productivity and help you accomplish more. Make an appointment with yourself every day to plan tomorrow today.\nSet up a system for getting things done\n\n    “Until you value yourself, you won’t value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it.”― M. Scott Peck\n\nOnce you declutter your routine and block out all activities that steal your time, you need a system to help you stick to your new way of work.\n\nSetting expectations will help you reduce many unnecessary interruptions.\n\nWrite down your system step-by-step and try to follow them as best as you can. Follow your systems and you’ll keep the clutter minimized.\n\nFocus more on functioning “smoothly” rather than quickly. You will improve your productivity and get more done in good time.",

        "title": "How To Stay Balanced",
        "description": "Finding balance in life is not about perfection. Or making sure everything receives equal attention. It’s about avoiding extremes. Trying to strike a perfect balance in life is itself extreme. It can’t be done. We’ll either convince ourselves we’ve done it and not realize we’ve missed something. Or we’ll realize how difficult it is and drive ourselves crazy trying to make it happen.\n\nChasing perfection is likely to cause us to be even less perfect. Pushing us further away from our ideal self. It’s an unobtainable goal. But what is obtainable is peace. Peace will get you closer to perfection than years of personal development ever will.\n\nWe don’t have to have life all figured out, we just have to be at peace. And having all the answers to life is not a prerequisite for peace. The pieces of life’s puzzle tend to come together over time. The sooner we let go, the sooner we free ourselves up for the right answers to come.\n\nPeace is about letting go. It’s also about environment. Don’t spend time with people who take away your peace, whether they mean to or not. Some people are too caught-up in drama. You don’t need to get caught-up in other people’s drama. You don’t need to think about what they think about or worry about what they worry about.\n\nSlow down the pace of your life. Find moments of silence and solitude. Remember what brings you peace. Unplug yourself from the world more often.\n\nEveryone needs times of silence and solitude. We need it to put life into perspective. We need it to connect with our true self. We need it to connect with God. We need it to untangle the webs we create in our mind. We need it to cleans ourselves from negative influences. We need it to stay balance.\n\nTo get more posts like this visit LivingWithConfidence.net and subscribe.",

        "title": "4 Bad Habits You Should Give Up to Feel More Confident",
        "description": "We all have part of our lives where we’d like to feel more confident:\n\n    Maybe you wish you were confident enough to speak up more often at work and express yourself.\n    Maybe you want to be more confident when it comes to dating and romance.\n    Or maybe you wish you had enough confidence to finally start that new business you’ve been dreaming of.\n\nWhile everybody knows what it feels like to lack confidence, here’s the thing most people don’t realize about how confidence works:\n\n    Feeling confident is often about what you do less of, not more of.\n\nSpecifically, many of us have subtle habits in our lives that chip away at our self-confidence and add to our insecurities.\n\nBut, if you can learn to identify and eliminate these confidence-killing habits, you’ll find that you’re naturally more confident than you realize.\n1. Trusting your feelings\n\nThe core dilemma when it comes to confidence is that your feelings override your values:\n\n    You want to ask that cute guy out (value), but you feel anxious and self-conscious (feelings). So you keep talking to your friends, the moment slips by, and your opportunity is gone.\n    A great idea occurs to you during your weekly meeting and you want to share it with your boss (value), but you immediately start worrying that she’ll think it’s silly or dumb (feeling). So you keep quiet and don’t mention it.\n\nOne way to look at these examples is that if you had felt more confident, you would have been able to act on your values. The trouble with this is, you can’t just make yourself feel confident anymore than you can make yourself feel happy or in love.\n\nFeeling confident comes from acting on your values despite feeling afraid.\n\nIf you habitually avoid asking people out, you’re going to habitually feel anxious about it. And if you habitually avoid speaking up during meetings, you’re going to habitually feel nervous about it.\n\nOn the other hand, if you ask someone out despite feeling anxious — or speak up during a meeting despite being afraid of getting criticized — you will start to feel more confident.\n\nOne of the reasons it’s so hard to act on our values when our feelings are pulling us away with fear is because we’re in the habit of trusting our feelings implicitly.\n\nOur culture tends to glorify feelings and emotions (think of any and every Disney movie you’ve ever seen). Unfortunately, this unqualified trust in feelings is misguided…\n\nYour feelings will lead you astray at least as often as they will help you.\n\nIt’s important to listen to your emotions, but never trust them. Give up the habit of trusting your feelings blindly and be prepared to ignore them and follow your values instead.\n\nOnce your mind sees you acting on your values despite how you feel, you will start to feel truly confident.\n\n    Courage is the birthplace of confidence.\n\n    — Debbie Millman\n\n2. People pleasing\n\nMost people don’t like conflict. In fact, most people are so afraid of conflict that they’ll go to some pretty extreme lengths to avoid it…\n\n    I worked with a client once who turned down a major promotion at work because she was afraid it would cause too much “friction” with another coworker.\n    Another client basically gave up spending time with his friends because his wife would get jealous and judgmental almost anytime he spent time away from her.\n\nBut sometimes fear of conflict leads to many smaller — though not necessarily less significant — sacrifices:\n\n    Never eating at your favorite restaurant because you “just go with” whatever you partner suggests\n    Always saying “yes” and taking on too many tasks because you don’t want to say “no” and disappoint people\n    Never watching your favorite type of movie because your roommate or friend hates that type of show\n\nWhatever the details of your specific situation, here’s what you need to know about being a people pleaser:\n\nWhen you habitually prioritize other people’s wants and needs before your own, you train your mind to devalue itself.\n\nThink about it: if you never stand up for yourself, of course you’re not going to feel very confident!\n\nLuckily, becoming more confident is often just a matter of being a little bit more assertive with people about what you want (or don’t want).\n\nOne of the simplest ways to boost your confidence is to practice asking for what you want and saying no to things you don’t want. But the key — that most people miss — is to start VERY small. Then once this becomes more comfortable, gradually work your way up to bigger things.\n\nIt’s good to think of others. But if it always comes at the expense of yourself, no one will end up happy in the long-run.\n\n    The reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself.\n\n    ― Rita Mae Brown\n\n3. Worrying about the future\n\nOur capacity to think about the future and imagine hypothetical scenarios is a wonderful skill and tool.\n\nFrom anticipating your opponent’s next move in a game of chess to landing a person on the moon, it clearly benefits us to be able to think about the future.\n\nAnd it’s especially useful to anticipate problems so we can address them early before they happen. Just imagine how many hypothetical problems all those engineers as NASA had to imagine before putting men in a spaceship to the moon!\n\nBut like so many of our most impressive tools and abilities, thinking about problems in the future can be unhealthy if done for the wrong reasons. This is especially the case with our tendency to worry.\n\nWorry is unproductive problem-solving.\n\nIf you spend time thinking about something that either A) Isn’t really a problem, or B) Isn’t a problem you can do anything about, you’re likely to end up worrying. Which means you’re getting all of the side effects of negative thinking like stress, anxiety, or panic with none of the benefits of genuine problem-solving.\n\nHere’s a specific example:\n\n    Your spouse goes on a trip to visit a relative. After seeing a news report of a plane crash in another country, you start worrying about your spouse’s plane crashing.\n\n    Even though you know that thinking about your spouse getting in a plane crash isn’t helping anyone, you feel compelled to continue thinking about it — playing scenarios over and over again in your head and worrying. And as a result, you feel increasingly anxious and tense.\n\nSo why do we do it? Why do we worry if it only makes us feel bad without accomplishing anything good?\n\nHere’s the thing about worry:\n\nWorry gives you the illusion of certainty. But in the end, all it does is fragilize you.\n\nEven though you can’t actually solve some hypothetical problem (your spouse getting in a crash, for example) thinking about it gives you the illusion of control. It makes you feel like you’re at least doing something.\n\nBut it’s all a mirage. And in the end, all that worry and anxiety just chip away at your confidence.\n\nIf you want to feel more genuinely confident, you must accept the fundamental uncertainty of life. There are simply some things that we can’t control. There are some very bad outcomes that we simply can’t prevent. And often, no amount of thinking and worrying will change that.\n\nBetter to face up to your fear of uncertainty with confidence than live in denial about it.\n\n    Instead of worrying about what you cannot control, shift your energy to what you can create.\n\n    ― Roy T. Bennett\n\n4. Ruminating on the past\n\nJust like worry gives the illusion of control over the future, rumination gives us a sense of false control over mistakes and losses in the past. Unfortunately, it can also lead to self-criticism, depression, and low self-esteem.\n\nOf course, reflecting on the past — including mistakes and negative events — can be a helpful activity. When you intentionally make time to consider the past in a balanced and objective way, it can often be a source of great relief and learning.\n\nBut it’s all too easy to end up dwelling on the past and thinking about it in an unhelpful way — this is called rumination:\n\n    If you’ve ever found yourself replaying the same mistake over and over in your mind without learning anything new, that’s rumination.\n    If you’ve ever found yourself obsessively imagining alternative histories and how you could have averted some tragedy or loss, that’s rumination.\n    If you’ve ever found yourself missing out on good things in the present because you’re stuck dwelling on negatives in the past, that’s rumination.\n\nOne of the many problems with getting into the habit of ruminating on past mistakes is that it erodes your confidence in the future.\n\nWhen you invest all your attention into yesterday, you have nothing left to invest into today.\n\nThis leads to a vicious self-fulfilling prophecy:\n\n    Because you spent all your attention and energy ruminating on the past, you can’t put as much into today. This leads to poor performance which then becomes evidence to support your already low self-confidence.\n\nTo stop wasting attention and energy with rumination, you must learn to accept and make peace with past mistakes and loss. Nobody likes feeling helpless to fix mistakes, but pretending you can change them by ruminating on them obsessively isn’t doing your confidence any favors.\n\nAccept that you are helpless to change the past and you will have an easier time letting go of your tendency to dwell on the past. And when you do that, your confidence is sure to rise.\n\n    My happiness grows in direct proportion to my acceptance, and in inverse proportion to my expectations.\n\n    ― Michael J. Fox\n\nAll You Need to Know\n\nTo feel more confident, focus on identifying and undoing the habits in your life that are killing your confidence:\n\nStop trusting your feelings\n\nStop people pleasing\n\nStop worrying about the future\n\nStop ruminating on the past",

        "description": "Sleep is a big part of life. We spend about 1/3rd of our life sleeping. Forcing ourselves to stay awake and treating sleep like it’s a problem that must be overcome, is very unnatural. We’re meant to sleep, a lot.\n\nSome people say they’ll sleep when they’re dead. But if you aren’t getting enough sleep, you’re half dead already.\n\nThere are a lot of important things that happen during sleep. It improves our physical health. It helps prevent depression and PTSD. And it’s also where a lot of our learning takes place (when sleeping, our brain processes the day’s experiences). We also sometimes have vivid and transcendental dreams that help us view life in a bigger way.\n\nFalling asleep is a form of surrender. It requires us to let go. We can fight it, but eventually we get so tired that we fall asleep whether we want to or not. In this way, sleep is a bit like death. We fight it, but inevitably it comes.\n\nTaking that analogy a bit further: We sometimes hear people say they’re going to fight against their illnesses (ie; “Cancer is not going to beat me.”). It’s admirable that they want to stick around for their family and do more good things in the world. If I was terminally ill I would want that too. (Though maybe it would be better to surrender to whatever path God chooses for us. Death now, or death later).\n\nThat’s sort of what it’s like sometimes when we’re tired. We fight against it, because there’s more we want to do. But eventually we’re forced to surrender.",

        "title": "Advice On Anxiety No One Tells You",
        "description": "    \n“Tomorrow and plans for tomorrow can have no significance at all unless you are in full contact with the reality of the present, since it is in the present and only in the present that you live.” — Alan Watts\n\nEnough is enough. You and I need to have a conversation.\n\nWhy is it that some people heal their anxiety and some don’t?\n\nIs it because of their race? Or their geographic location? Maybe it’s because they make more money?\n\nNo, no. Those don’t sound right.\n\nOkay, so what is it then that leaves some people debilitated by their “disorder” and allows others to break free from it?\n\nIn my opinion, the difference comes down to their ability to ignore the standard prescriptions.\n\nTheir belief that the cure lies within them, not outside of them.\n\nTheir ability to not be the victim of their situation.\n\nThey had to view their “condition” as a challenge that requires strategy, skill, and wisdom to complete. It would not have been possible to overcome their anxiety if they had believed it could never be cured.\n\nAfter spending months healing myself and learning from those who had gone before me, I came across some uncanny advice that I wish I would have learned sooner. Every lesson may not be for you, but I hope that you will find some more healing from this piece.\nHiding Behind Labels Is Killing You\n\nThe majority of people that reach out to me tell me that they have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. They shoot out new and elongated acronyms that are supposed to describe what is going on inside their mind.\n\nNow, I’m sure these labels help some people come to grips with their mental state, but for the majority of us, all these labels do is kill our chance of healing.\n\nIf you tell yourself that you are an anxious person, then that label becomes your identity, making it next to impossible to ever break free.\n\nAnxiety is an emotion, not an identity. Realize that the emotion will always be there, but that you don’t have to be its slave.\nLean Into Your Fear\n\nAfter months of working at a job I hated, I quit and moved to an entirely new city. The thought of doing this scared the shit out of me, so I knew it had to be done.\n\nI feared to be alone in a new city with my “condition.” What if I had a panic attack? Would I be close enough to a hospital? Who would I call?\n\nOh, the pleasures of neuroses.\n\nBeing viewed less successful by taking a job with a low salary terrified me.\n\nBut mostly, I feared the idea of getting back on the subway where I had my first panic attack.\n\nLo in behold, the moment I stepped into what I feared most I began to gain confidence in my ability to tackle the next challenge. I lived a full year in New York, and it was a year of tremendous growth and healing.\n\nIf I never stepped into that fear, I may still be the slave of my anxiety. But because I took that leap of faith, I’m now able to be in control.\nPanic Is Controllable\n\nFor eighteen months straight, I feared panic. It was brutal. I was always on edge.\nOn the subway. At work. In meetings. The fear of panic peeping its head up and exploding my insides was an ever-present thought, just enough off the surface for me to live a pseudo-normal life.\n\nThen one day I had had enough. I knew that there had to be someone else out there that had learned to stop panic attacks naturally.\n\nAs dumb as it sounds, I had never thought to look for resources that could help me. I wanted to do it on my own. And I thought I could.\n\nI couldn’t.\n\nAfter mere minutes of searching on the internet, I came across thousands of great, free resources on stopping panic attacks.\n\nWhy had I never thought to research before? Well, that has to deal with the next piece of advice.\nDo Your Own Research\n\nFirst off, I know the internet can be a terrifying place filled with fake news and unreliable sources, but books, on the other hand, tend to be less so. I wish I would have realized that all of the answers to my questions were in a book somewhere. All I had to do was look.\n\nAfter I had my first panic attack, a close friend warned me against reading about anxiety. She said it had upset her and feared it would do the same to me. So I took her advice.\n\nIt took me a year and a half before I discovered the incredible amount of resources out there to help people going through what I was experiencing. It was a revelation that was paramount to my healing.\n\nDo your research. If you are struggling with something, I guarantee you someone has gone through something similar and written about it. Use the power of the internet to find these resources and connect with the creators.\n\nPlease, if you haven’t already, search Amazon for books on healing anxiety. I have listed some favorites below.\n\nPlay It Away — Charlie Hoehn\n\nMindful Way Through Anxiety — Susan Orsillo & Lizabeth Roemer\n\nWisdom of Insecurity — Alan Watts\nThe Five W’s\n\nThe five W’s are the base of a good story line. They can also be used to highlight the areas of your life they may be in misalignment.\n    Who: do you spend most of your time with? Are they adding stress or aiding your growth? No one is sacred here. Remove anyone that is not helping you heal or else you may always stay anxious.\n\n    What: are you working on/do you do between 8–6? What do you spend your time doing? What do you consume through your five senses? What are you waiting for? What is holding you back? What do you believe that is keeping you from healing?\n\n    When: do you go to bed? When do you wake up? When do you leave work? When are you going to make a move? When are you going to start healing yourself? When were you the happiest?\n\n    Why: are you in your job? Why do you feel like you need to get the next thing? Why do you need external validation? Why are you reading this article? Why do you do anything that you do?\n\n    Where: in the world do you live? Where do you sleep? Where do you work? Where are you trying to get to? Where is this path leading you? Where do you want to be?\n\nI have found a close examination of the five W’s to be revealing of where in my life I need to make significant changes. Often it is right in front of our eyes.\nYou Can Heal Without Drugs\n\nI followed the typical American path.\n\nI had a problem, so I went to a doctor to get the easy fix. Instead of looking at the root of the problem, I wanted medication to heal the branches. Of course, this did nothing to solve the actual problem causing my anxiety. Rather, it exacerbated it. I felt lost and foggy.\n\nI needed a new route to healing that didn’t involve medication. And I found one by looking at the problem itself, me.\n\nMy life was in misalignment in almost every facet. I was eating poorly. I was getting terrible sleep. Working all the time with an insatiable desire to “be someone.” I had alienated myself from those closest to me.\n\nSo, piece by piece, I started patching up the holes in my life. And day by day I began to feel less anxious. Until one day I felt normal again.\n\nI’m not saying you should get off your medication or never take them. I’m just urging you to use it as a supplement to other lifestyle changes. There are other ways, more sustainable ways, to heal yourself without reliance on medication.\n\nYou have the power.\nRadical Self Introspection Is a Must; Not an Option\n\nIt’s funny that we humans spend so much time preparing to live, but rarely live. The living is brutal. Knowing your true self is not a fun endeavor as some portray it to be. You will have to wrestle with darkness as you go down and in.\n\nBut…\n\nIt is a critical step that you must take on your path to healing. You can learn so much by looking deeply into your inner life. Self-awareness is a force multiplier.\n\nFor the next 21 days pose this question to yourself and try to answer it without thinking:\n\n    What do you want?\n\nYou will be surprised by what you find.\nIt Will Take Time, But It Will Be Worth It\n\nThe climb out of the pit takes time. At times you will slip and fall a couple of lengths. But keep climbing. Even if it feels like you are walking in quicksand, keep walking.\n\nIt will take longer than you want it to, but the journey is worth it.\nAnxiety Is Your Friend\n\nIn Parker Palmer’s Let Your Life Speak, he articulates a great analogy for associating with negative emotions. In a conversation with a trusted counselor, he was asked if he had ever viewed depression as a friend. Someone who wanted to ground him, rather than kill him.\n\nHe hadn’t.\n\nHe then goes on to explain how he realized that this friend had been there his whole life. Calling him to his true self. Trying to get his attention. But he always had ignored it, focusing on ambition and external validation, instead of inner peace and vocation. By ignoring his friend for so long, it was only possible to get his attention by dropping a nuclear bomb on Palmer’s head.\n\nThis bomb was depression.\n\nPalmer’s story speaks so true to my life. My friend had also always been there, and I too had always ignored him. For fear that listening to this inner voice would leave me at odds with the success I so longed to achieve. Then, just like Palmer’s story, my friend couldn’t watch this destruction anymore and dropped a nuclear bomb, anxiety, on my head.\n\nThe bomb worked. I woke up.\n\nI now view anxiety as my friend. Someone that is trying to pull me to the live I am meant to live, not the one I think I “should” be living. It’s my very own bullshit detector that knows me more than I do.\n\nWhat is your friend trying to tell you?\n\nHave there been times early on in your life when it sought to get your attention, but you didn’t listen? Maybe you got fired, or you had a sudden deep inspiration or left a relationship?\n\nIf so, look deeper.\n\nDid you take it as a sign and change your life, or did you let it pass and move on living almost the same way?\n\nListen to your inner self. It’s your true self. It knows the path that you long to take. Stop being afraid to follow it.\nYou Are Not Alone\n\nLast, and most importantly, the advice that everyone fails to tell you when you are in the depths of this type of darkness is that YOU ARE NOT ALONE.\n\nA vast majority of people go through spells of depression and anxiety sometime during their life. It may seem that your experience is one of a kind, but I promise you it is not.\n\nThere are so many people out there willing to help you and show you the way. Individuals who have been where you are today. Take their help. Get better. So you can give the world your gifts. We are waiting for you!\nGo Deeper\n",

        "title": "The Ultimate Guide to Dealing With Anxiety",
        "description": "\n    Do you worry that terrible things will happen even if they are unlikely?\n    Do you often feel worried, ‘on edge’ or nervous?\n    Do you criticize yourself harshly?\n    Do you often assume that things will turn out badly?\n    Do you need to think things through for a long time before you act?\n    Do you procrastinate or avoid doing things altogether because of anxiety?\n    If you answered yes to any of these, chances are that you’re dealing with some degree of anxiety. That’s not necessarily bad; anxiety is a basic human emotion. But it can become uncomfortable and even debilitating. And that’s when it makes sense to do something about it. In this beginner’s guide, we cover everything you need to know.\nWhat is anxiety in the first place?\n\nThe obvious starting point is to understand what anxiety is in the first place. Psychologists and researchers mostly define it as\n\n    an emotional state characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts and physical changes like increased blood pressure.\n\nIt’s the human body’s physical response to danger. And it’s made up of three components: thoughts, feelings and behaviors.\nWithout uncomfortable feelings, negative and repetitive thoughts and dysfunctional behaviors (like avoidance) there’s no anxiety. It can go different ways but it’s always some combination of those three ingredients that make life uncomfortable.\n\nWhen psychologists talk about anxiety, they often refer to anxiety disorders. And about 40 million people in the US alone suffer from some form of those. But even more are simply prone to anxiety. That means that they simply have a general tendency to feel anxious, nervous or uneasy.\n\nIn whatever category you fall, there are a couple of problems that anxiety causes. The good news is that there’s something we can do about this. The bad news is that many people don’t know what. But that’s why you’re here.\nThe reason you experience anxiety\n\nAnxiety is caused by an over-reaction of the human fight-or-flight response. This innate reaction has developed over more than hundred thousand years of evolution in order to protect us from danger. It’s a biological process that kicks in whenever the brain detects something dangerous.\n\nImagine you live in a world full of dangerous animals. That’s the life many of our early human ancestors had. When you were walking through the woods and a wild tiger crossed your path, you had to react quickly. Your entire body and your brain had to switch into survival mode. And that’s what the fight-or-flight reaction is designed to do. The heart beat increases, you breathe faster and you can’t think of anything but the danger in front of you. Without the fight-or-flight response, our ancestors wouldn’t have survived so successfully.\n\nThe same reaction, however, also causes anxiety. And that’s when it’s not helpful anymore. People with social anxiety, for example, feel the same intense physiological response when they interact with other people. Their brains trigger a response that developed to help them in life-threatening situations — but they do this when there is no real danger in sight. The same happens during panic attacks. The fight-or-flight reaction gets completely out of hand — often without an apparent reason.\n\nWhat’s important to understand is that even though this isn’t rational we all know it one way or another. Imagine you’re young and alone at home at night. You hear a noise that you wouldn’t even pay attention to during the day. But hearing it alone at night, this noise becomes scary. That’s what anxiety is. It makes your heart beat faster and you start to look out for other things that could be scary. Your mind becomes hyper-focused on figuring out if you’re in danger and you get extra sensitive to anything that could be scary. Regular anxiety feels the same way.\nThe many kinds of anxiety\n\nAnxiety can come in all kinds of different shapes and forms. It causes various symptoms but all of them fall into one of the three categories. Thoughts, feelings and behaviors.\n1. Worrying and rumination\n\nIt’s quite common for anxious people to worry a lot. There’s an urge to think things through to prevent bad things from happening. Or to replay events in your mind to find out how other people might have perceived you. The problem is that most of the time people end up going over negative thoughts without actually solving the problem.\n\nAnxious feelings and worrisome thoughts then form a feedback loop. Negative thoughts cause unpleasant feelings which in turn lead to more worries.\nThere’s a whole range of options but the most effective ones involve dealing with those thoughts directly.\n\nIn cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), people gradually learn that their anxiety is caused by so-called thinking errors. Those are irrational thought patterns that we can learn to identify and then restructure systematically.\n\nIn acceptance and commitment therapy, people learn to see their thoughts as mere events in their mind. Or put differently, ACT teaches how to distance oneself from one’s thoughts. The key here is to see which thoughts are helpful and which are not.\n\nMindfulness-based approaches then use a uniquely human ability. There’s a space between whatever happens to us (the stimulus) and how we respond to it (the response. The ability to widen and use this space is trained by regular mindfulness practice. As a result, thoughts and external events lose their power over us as we learn to respond to them differently.\n2. Negative Self-Talk\n\nWe talk to ourselves all the time. In fact, everybody does. But when anxiety interferes, this self-talk can easily turn negative. Whether it’s self-doubt or relentless self-criticism, anxiety can turn almost any situation into something bad.\n\nThis self-talk is often so habitual and salient that we don’t even notice it. It’s as normal to us as water is to a fish. We are surrounded by it. And even though it’s irrational it always sounds like the truth.\n\nThe dilemma is this: Self-talk doesn’t only affect what’s in your head. It has real-world consequences. The critical inner voices become louder every time you even think about trying something new or meaningful. And every time you give in, that’s another blow to your self-image.\n\nSolutions:\n\nThe goal of acceptance and commitment therapy is to help people understand that it’s possible to not to believe every thought. That’s how people learn to let go of thoughts that are unhelpful and only focus on the ones that help live a happy and meaningful life. Acceptance — you learn — is a powerful strategy when it comes to self-doubt.\n\nAnother way to counter this anxiety-fueled self-talk is by offering self-compassion. This strategy has been researched only recently but with very promising results. It works by shifting the relationship we have with ourselves. Instead of treating ourselves like an adversary or a hyper-ambitious parent, we become our own best friend. For many people that’s not easy at first but can bring transformative changes.\n3. Procrastination\n\nAnxiety and procrastination are often not put together — yet they are closely linked. Because chronic procrastination is an emotional strategy for dealing with stress and situations that make you feel anxious.\n\nScientists define procrastination as the voluntary delay of an action despite foreseeable negative future consequences. In other words, it’s choosing short-term relief at the cost of long-term benefits. The essence of procrastination is we’re giving in to feeling good.\n\nSolutions:\n\nThe way we think influences the way we feel and behave. And the underlying reason for procrastination is hidden beliefs like fear of failure or fear of getting out of one’s comfort zone. As long as we (unconsciously) believe that procrastinating is the best option, we will keep putting things off. That’s why the CBT solution to procrastination is to identify those false beliefs and — over time — reframe them.\n\nThe other helpful way of dealing with procrastination involves dealing with the feelings of procrastination. The key insight is that we not just avoid a particular task but we avoid the feelings that somehow come with that task. The key skill is learning to experience uncomfortable feelings without giving in to them.\n4. Avoiding anything that may cause anxiety\n\nAnxiety often causes us to avoid certain situations. It can be avoiding working out for the fear of causing a panic attack. It can be not taking an exam for the fear of failing it. Or it can be cancelling a date with friends for the stress of meeting them and fearing we might say something embarrassing.\n\nThe root cause of this avoidance is so-called thinking errors. We imagine catastrophes, jump to conclusions about what other people think or filter out positive information and focus only on the negative.\n\nSolutions:\n\nUltimately, avoiding can only be solved by the most obvious strategy there is. Exposure. That means gradually facing whatever we avoid. But that’s not done blindly or without preparation. Just do it may sound great but for many anxious people it’s an unworkable strategy. In order to face anxious-provoking situations, it helps to use CBT and mindfulness strategies. And then gradually increase the challenge and we will notice that things aren’t as bad as they seem after all.\n5. Fear of Criticism\n\nIt’s common knowledge that feedback is important to become better. People who are anxious, though, tend to avoid it because it feels uncomfortable and even threatening.\n\nWe fear negative feedback because we habitually misinterpret it. We take it personally, think it’s permanent and that it applies to all areas of our lives. As a result, we end up feeling like a failure. If we look at it from this angle, it’s only logical to be afraid of criticism. And to try to avoid it at all cost.\n\nSolution:\nIn order to reduce this fear of criticism, we need to reframe those underlying beliefs. Change happens when we — over and over again — make ourselves aware that criticism isn’t as bad as we make it out to be. Systematically and step by step, cognitive behavioral therapy helps identify the reasons for our fear of criticism. And then helps establish alternative, more realistic thinking patterns.\n6. Perfectionism\n\nAnxiety-related perfectionism can get in the way of both feeling happy and being successful. It causes all kinds of problems such as prioritizing the wrong tasks, becoming frustrated with ourselves and putting those things off that really matter.\n\nPerfectionism is the result of a toxic combination of thinking patterns: Exceptionally high standards and a fear of failure. Many of us are afraid of failing, at least some of the time. But fear of failure is when we allow that fear to stop us doing the things that can move us forward to achieve our goals.\n\nSolutions:\nAfter about fifteen years of research, it’s now clear that self-compassion is a much more effective strategy if you’re striving to learn, get better and achieve good results. There’s a simple reason for this: Perfectionists focus much of their energy on avoiding mistakes. People who are self-compassionate on the other hand can move past mistakes more quickly and are much better at learning from mistakes. That’s because they don’t see mistakes as threats but as learning opportunities.\n\nClosely related to that solution is shifting from a so-called fixed mindset to a growth mindset. Through cognitive reframing, it’s possible to create new and more constructive beliefs about failure, progress and change. That’s what psychologists call a growth mindset.\n7. Panic attacks\n\nA panic attack is a rush of intense anxiety which triggers strong physical sensations — often without an obvious reason. The changes in body and mind take place so rapidly that you experience them as an “attack”.\n\nThe key problem with panic attacks is that we experience them as truly dangerous. In reality, they are not dangerous at all. They simply are an uncomfortable overreaction of one’s nervous system.\n\nPanic attacks happen because we start to associate certain changes in the body (increased heart beat or sweating for example). And we develop a fear of those feelings because we believe they are the signs of a coming panic attack.\n\nSolutions:\n\nEffective interventions often focus on a combination of things. On the one hand it’s helpful to learn to relax deliberately. Being able to turn down one’s own nervous reaction is a key skill for any anxious person but it’s especially important if you struggle with panic.\n\nMindfulness skills also come in handy as they help take away the frightening power of uncomfortable sensations. In treatment for panic attacks, it’s used to teach people to experience uncomfortable sensations without reacting negatively to them. And that helps them short-circuit the vicious cycle of panic.\n\nThe third and most important strategy to manage panic attacks is confront anxiety-provoking situations on purpose. The key is to face what we’d normally avoid — but doing this step by step and with the help of mindfulness and relaxation techniques.\nAnxiety FAQs\n\nIn this section, we’re covering the most frequent questions that arise. If there are things you’d like to know that we do not cover, feel free to reach out.\n\nShould I use medication to treat anxiety?\nThe short answer here is that medication can be a useful form of help for some people. It is used to reduce symptoms and that’s why it’s usually most effective when you combine it with professional therapy. If you consider taking anti-anxiety medication, it’s strongly advised to consult a doctor.\n\nAre they different kinds of anxiety?\nYes, indeed anxiety is not the same for everyone. Firstly, it can come in different degrees. Some people experience mild forms of anxiety while others really cannot live a normal life because their symptoms are too strong. Then there are also different types of anxiety disorders:\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): This anxiety disorder comes with a lot of worrying and rumination. People who struggle with GAD usually worry about all kinds of things and this often interferes with living a normal social life and functioning effectively at work or school.\n\nPanic Disorder: People who routinely experience panic attacks typically fall in this category. Those attacks are sudden bouts of intense fear. They build up quickly and can feel live-threatening.\n\nPhobias: Phobia is the intense fear of an object or a particular situation which is out of proportion to the actual danger. For example: spiders, heights, flying or public speaking. Phobias are often not as debilitating as other anxiety disorders because they only affect one area of life.\n\nSocial Anxiety Disorder: This is the most common form of anxiety disorder. It’s root cause is the intense fear of social situations. People who struggle with social anxiety typically avoid being the center of attention and being criticized and they often worry about doing something wrong or embarrassing.\n\nDoes anxiety usually go away by itself?\nGeneral anxiety is temporary. It goes away after a while. Chronic conditions like generalized anxiety disorder, on the other hand, usually do not stop without some effort. The interventions and treatments described above, though, are well-validated methods that help many people who suffer.\n\nWhat are some simple things I can do right away?\n\n    Cut down on coffee, black tea and energy drinks. They activate the sympathetic nervous system and this can increase anxiety.\n    Physical exercise like running or swimming can be an effective anxiety treatment.\n    Sleep deprivation is not only a symptom of anxiety but also a cause. If you’re experiencing anxiety, it’s advisable to get a regular sleep routine.\n\nWhat about people who’ve always had a tendency to feel nervous and anxious?\n\nSome people are more prone to anxiety than others. This tendency is the result of our genetic make-up and our upbringing. If you believe that you fall in this category, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you’re having an anxiety disorder. However, you can still benefit from the therapies and interventions outlined in this guide.\n\nThis post is not intended to give medical advice and does not substitute professional help.",

        "title": "How does your anxiety feel?",
        "description": "Ever wonder why tightness in your jaw and shoulders are linked to anxiety? And did you know that you can use curiosity to change your relationship to anxiety and fear?\n\nThe Irish novelist and poet James Stephens wrote, “curiosity will conquer fear even more than bravery will.” I love this — but how can it be?\n\nAs I’ve mentioned in previous columns, because fear is the most basic of survival mechanisms, when we get scared, we immediately react. For example, when someone yells “look out,” we don’t have time to check the credibility of the source. We quickly duck or jump out of the way, and then look around after the fact to see if the threat was real. And when there is a lot of fear out there, fear itself can become quite contagious and spread simply via tone of voice or facial expression. So how can curiosity possibly help?\n\nIn my last column, I talked about two different types of curiosity: deprivation curiosity and interest curiosity. Think of deprivation curiosity as the destination type of curiosity. If we don’t know something, we get that restless itch to go find the answer. Once we get the answer, that itch has been scratched. The journey is over. We’ve arrived at our destination. Interest curiosity, on the other hand, is all about the journey. We don’t experience the itch to get somewhere because we’re already there — as in, the journey is the destination. We become interested in whatever is happening at any given moment.\n\n    Curiosity as a quality of awareness is really helpful for helping us unwind stress and anxiety instead of winding ourselves up more.\n\nAn easy way to tell the difference between deprivation curiosity and interest curiosity is to simply check in with how they each feel in your body. Deprivation curiosity pushes or pulls you along — urging you to action, while interest curiosity is patient and inviting. With interest curiosity, there is no rush because there is no place to get to.\n\nTry this yourself right now. Simply feel into your hands and see which one feels warmer. Is it your right hand or your left hand? Or are they both exactly the same temperature? If you noticed a difference in temperature between the two, do you know why this is the case? I’ll explain the physiology now. Ready?\n\nFirst, take a moment to notice what it feels like to not know the answer. Actually, as you might have already figured out, there isn’t some medical explanation as to why one of your hands might feel warmer than the other. But hopefully, from this little self-experiment, you saw and felt the difference between interest and deprivation curiosity.\n\nJust to make sure you can really tell the difference, let’s return to James Stephens’ quote: “Curiosity will conquer fear even more than bravery will.” Why might this be? How can curiosity possibly be stronger than bravery? If you’re interested, that’s your deprivation curiosity urging you to learn why. Here’s a bit of science behind this.\n\nLet’s start with fear learning. Let’s say you’re walking across the street, and someone yells “look out!” You instinctively jump out of the way to avoid the car that is speeding around the corner. If your body and mind stopped there, you’d then go about the rest of your day as though nothing happened because nothing bad happened.\n\nBut what do you really do? You look around and see that you narrowly avoided getting hit by a car, you feel your heart racing, and you start thinking about how you could have been killed. Later, you might even replay the event to a friend, describing how this reckless driver almost killed you. When you retell that story, you might notice that your heart is racing, your body is a bit contracted, and you feel a bit afraid — just by recalling the event. Later, if you walk quickly up a flight of stairs, which gets your heart pumping, that increased heart rate might trigger you to recall the event.\n\nYes, our bodies hold associative somatic memories, which is just a fancy term for pairing certain physiological states with memories of events and emotional states. In this case, the heart beating fast gets paired with the memory of almost getting killed.\n\nLet’s explore an everyday example together.\n\nWhen you’re stressed or anxious, do you hold this tension in your shoulders or jaw? If you are someone who holds stress in your shoulders and back, you can trigger yourself to feel stressed or anxious simply by tightening your shoulders. That’s the physiologic state triggering an emotional state because the two have been paired in the past.\n\nSo knowing all of this, what can you do?\n\nThis is where the different types of curiosity come in. If you notice that you’re feeling anxious, maybe you start to wonder why. “Why am I anxious?” you might think and then try to figure out why this is the case so you can fix it. That’s deprivation curiosity — and the destination there is often a dead end. Many of my clinic patients get stuck in these sorts of why habit loops. They can’t figure out what triggered their anxiety, and then they start worrying about how long it will last or what they can do about it, and in the meantime, they tighten up into a little ball of anxiety.\n\n    Instead of focusing on why you’re anxious, focus on what anxiety feels like right in that moment.\n\nDon’t fall into this trap.\n\nIf you notice yourself getting stuck in a why habit loop, you can use interest curiosity to pull you out of it. Instead of focusing on the why, focus on the what. This is important so I’m going to repeat it. Instead of focusing on why you’re anxious, focus on what anxiety feels like right in that moment. Get interested in what stress or anxiety feels like in your body. And just like the hand exercise you did earlier, you can ask questions that pique your interest curiosity. Hmmm, do I feel this more on my right side or my left side? Is it more in the front or the back of my body? What are the physical sensations? Do I feel heat or coolness? Is there a vibratory quality?\n\nThis is not to say that curiosity will magically cure your anxiety overnight, but it is to suggest that curiosity as a quality of awareness is really helpful for helping us unwind stress and anxiety instead of winding ourselves up more. This practice helps us change how we relate to our emotions and body sensations rather than trying to fix or change them. Curiosity is a key skill for helping people step out of anxiety and worry habit loops. And as I’ve mentioned in earlier columns, our clinical studies show that app-based mindfulness can reduce anxiety by 57%–63% even in people with generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nBut you don’t need an app to awaken your own curiosity, you can simply start practicing now. Whenever you feel stressed, you can simply drop into your body and do that right, left, front, back exercise. Where do I feel it? What does it feel like? Start small, and practice this in short moments many times throughout the day. If you are triggered by something you read or saw that is scary, take a moment to stop, get curious about your body’s reaction, and see if that can prevent you from winding up more. Rinse and repeat.\n\nI’ll end with wise words from Tigger, of Winnie the Pooh, “life is not about how fast you run or how high you climb, but how well you bounce.”\n\nSo see if today, you can move beyond bravery and instead build your bounce by cultivating curiosity — one moment at a time.",
        "summary": "An easy way to tell the difference between deprivation curiosity and interest curiosity is to simply check in with how they each feel in your body. Actually, as you might have already figured out, there isn’t some medical explanation as to why one of your hands might feel warmer than the other. If you are triggered by something you read or saw that is scary, take a moment to stop, get curious about your body’s reaction, and see if that can prevent you from winding up more. Instead of focusing on why you’re anxious, focus on what anxiety feels like right in that moment. Instead of focusing on why you’re anxious, focus on what anxiety feels like right in that moment. First, take a moment to notice what it feels like to not know the answer. Just to make sure you can really tell the difference, let’s return to James Stephens’ quote: “Curiosity will conquer fear even more than bravery will.” Why might this be? We quickly duck or jump out of the way, and then look around after the fact to see if the threat was real.",

        "title": "How to Worry Less and Finally Find Ways to Deal with Anxiety",
        "description": "I waited too long to take proper action against my anxiety attacks. What once were haphazard hyperventilation attacks turned into panic attacks as stress increased. Definitely not fun.\n\nI’ve found it hard to accept that I apparently had a mental issue. For years I took pride in the fact that I was always good humored, positive and had never felt an inch of depression or intense fear.\n\nI’ve seen friends, and even my ex-girlfriend, suffer from depression. I never got it. I couldn’t imagine feeling like that. Therefore, I couldn’t really understand them. And when you’re in a relationship, understanding each other is vital.\n\nIn the past year, I’ve experienced more stress than usual. My company was heading into the abyss, and I couldn’t take control. (In the end, we did, but it was a long road). The sheer idea of bankruptcy, or having no job, no certainties, no idea of what I wanted to do to make a living (writing doesn’t get me there — yet). I knew I liked to be in control, but I didn’t know it was this intense!\n\nI started gaining weight, partying too much, drinking too much. I felt miserable. I was always tired. And sometimes out of the blue, I was hit by a panic attack. A feeling I don’t wish for people to experience, but alas, we do.\n\nI was stretched too thin. I was arrogant in thinking I could ‘cure’ myself. But who was I kidding? I told myself my problem wasn’t severe enough, other people suffered more than me, mentally. I feared being judged to seek help. However, it was that fear I needed to conquer. After another severe panic attack, I finally went to a psychologist. Probably the best decision I made this year.\n\nHere’s what I learned about tackling anxiety and how you can take steps to deal with your anxiety too. Be warned: one can never cure anxiety, but you can learn to cope with it and move on with your life.\n\n    “People have a hard time letting go of their suffering. Out of a fear of the unknown, they prefer suffering that is familiar.” — Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nHow I learned to battle my anxiety with therapy\n\nMy preconceived ideas that therapy wasn’t for me were all false and stories in my head. After having conquered the fear to go to therapy, it was liberating. Even after two sessions, let alone more.\n\n    It’s great to tell someone who is ‘objective’ about what troubles you, about your fears and insecurities. Without a filter, without holding up a mask. Letting down your walls and armor. I felt naked, but talking about it didn’t feel scary once I sat there.\n\nI was lucky, my therapist was a good one. His wall decorated by impressive degrees from Ivy-League American universities. Not that that should be the sole reason for his good performance.\n\nAt first, he seemed stern, like your typical impatient math teacher. But he wasn’t. He wasn’t trying to be my friend. He sat in that chair to get results. Baring my past, ideas, insecurities, and soul. After the first session I was wrecked, but the second got better, and the third… Luckily his ‘office’ view was over the Amsterdam canals, not a bad place to pour your heart out.\n\nWe analyzed three things concerning my anxiety:\n\n    My behavior, what caused the panic attacks, the hyperventilating? Even during casual conversations with friends, I hyperventilated. Usually in a public space. I worried too much, about what other people might think of me (and I gladly fed those stories in my mind), about what my friend might think, about my to-do list, about my next meeting, about an argument I might have with my dad… (Trust me this is draining and it all happens simultaneously).\n    Pause. I needed to analyze my thoughts, where they stem from. Most importantly, I needed to stop the thought loops and reflect.\n    Which leads to cognition. How could I solve the problem? How could I adjust my behavior?\n\n    “What upsets people is not things themselves, but their judgments about these things.” — Epictetus.\n\nSo, let’s get to the practical stuff, the tools I have learned to better cope with my anxiety:\n\n1. Hit pause. When I have an ‘attack’, I feel my breath rising, causing short and high breaths in my throat. I need to literally stop. I need to bring back my breath to my stomach. You can do this by inhaling deeply for 3 seconds, exhale long for 6 seconds. Repeat that 3 times. Calm yourself down. Stop what you’re doing.\n\n2. Reflect and stop thought loops. The stories you are telling yourself (of what someone else might think, say or do) must stop. They are false. Can you really know what someone else is thinking? Usually, they aren’t thinking about you at all. They have enough to worry about themselves.\n\nContinually thinking about what you must do during the day can consume you. Take one task and complete it, then move on to the next. Tackle the biggest task first (this relieves the most stress). And if you haven’t finished your list, well, there’s always tomorrow. Will someone die if you don’t cross everything off your list? Will you?\n\n3. Recognize story-telling behavior that’s completely fictional. This can be thinking for another person, having 100s of arguments with someone in your head, negative self-talk, feeling like everyone is focusing on you, on your insecurities.\n\nEarth to you! Who is telling you all this? Can you hear what others are thinking? Then you have a precious and magical gift! Unless you’re Mel Gibson in What Women Want, then, no you can’t. Can you predict reactions, the future? No. Realize that it’s all made up — by yourself. Gently push those thoughts away.\n\n    “You wouldn’t worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.” — Eleanor Roosevelt\n\n4. Take distance from your thoughts and counter them with what if’s. What’s the worst that someone may think? What’s the worst outcome of not being on time, of not having finished something, of losing control, of going bankrupt, etc? What’s the worst a friend might think about things you’re insecure about Will they honestly think badly of you, even if you’ve hung out for years?\n\nDig deep. Usually, it’s not the end of the world. It might suck, but you’re still you. And chances are you won’t end up in the gutter, with having one boot to your name and a hand me down coat.\n\n    You walk around with all your years of earthly experience telling yourself the same version of a story to yourself day in, day out. Don’t tell yourself things that aren’t true.\n\n5. Relax. Don’t rush yourself. I am always feeling like I have to be quick, fast, constantly watching the clock. Learn from the Spanish (mañana, mañana) — although probably not too much. There are great tools to relax, more on that in the next section.\nTools for calming oneself down\n\n    Headspace: a great app to learn guided meditation (there’s even a managing anxiety pack of 30-days). The first 10 days are free. I’d quit it for half a year and immediately noticed I was more anxious. I start my day with a 10/15-minute meditation (almost every day). It’s quite expensive, you can also try the free app Oak, build by Kevin Rose\n    Pause: read, watch some tv, go for a walk, call a friend, treat yourself to a nice lunch. Anything to break your thinking or worrying. Focus on something else which is relaxing.\n    Get a massage, go to a sauna, go floating or treat yourself so an entire spa day.\n    Exercise — it doesn’t matter what, my advice is doing something you enjoy.\n    Talk about your worries with a friend, your girlfriend/boyfriend, your mom. It helps to vent.\n    Study Stoic philosophy. I’m not prophesizing here; you can make up your own mind. It has helped me a great deal over the past years, it’s about the things you can control and letting go of the things you can’t. I’m not doing it justice and it deserves more posts, but I recommend you check out Ryan Holiday or Tim Ferriss on the topic.\n\n    “Today I escaped anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions — not outside.” — Marcus Aurelius.\n\nWhat if I can’t break my anxiety patterns?\n\nWell, first of all, seek professional help. I knew all the things above already, but I just couldn’t get myself to act on it without help. You possibly can’t either. And that’s ok. You are far from alone in this!\n\nIf you aren’t able to calm yourself down, to let go of thoughts or behavior, then analyze where it went wrong later in the day. Buy a journal. Reflect on what happened. Why couldn’t you stop making up stories? Why were you so rushed? Analyze your emotions and behavior.\n\nHow did you feel? How did you behave? Not the way you would have liked? Well, how did you want to feel or behave? Why weren’t you able to? Why?Write it down. Learn more about yourself.\nSo, now what?\n\nEmbark on your mental exercising journey. You might not be able to lift 100kg the first go but start with 5kg. It will get easier with time.\n\nYou’ll never be ‘cured’, and that’s fine, as long as you learn to be better at dealing with your anxiety.\n\nI told my friends and family I went to therapy for my anxiety attacks. None of them had ever noticed anything… And I was always thinking everyone must’ve. Plus, they were far from judgmental, they’re proud of me for taking the step. (And I come from a family in which no one dares to talk about their feelings.) Often the conversations later on dealt with their worries and it’s great to talk about it with one another (and even to get to know each other better).\n\nSo fall, stand up, rise, learn and repeat.\nNOW I WANT TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR TIPS. WHAT’S HELPING YOU MANAGE YOUR ANXIETY?\n\nLet’s end with my favorite quote.\n\n    “We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.” — Seneca",
        "summary": "I worried too much, about what other people might think of me (and I gladly fed those stories in my mind), about what my friend might think, about my to-do list, about my next meeting, about an argument I might have with my dad… (Trust me this is draining and it all happens simultaneously).

        "title": "5 Techniques That Freed Me From Decades Of Anxiety",
        "description": "Two years ago, I trudged into a therapist’s office, desperate for help. It had been weeks since I last slept for more than three hours in one night. For thirty years, I had battled occasional bouts with insomnia, but this was one spell I couldn’t shake.\n\nThe therapist used cognitive behavioral therapy to fix me. Like all my other attempts at a solution, I experienced short term relief but then regressed. Feeling defeated, I surrendered. I figured I’d have to live this way forever.\n\nMonths later, I stumbled onto an article about anxiety; this was the source of my problems, I realized. Low-grade anxiety had been a constant companion of mine since childhood, though I hadn’t realized it until I was in my 40s.\n\nThere were occasional debilitating moments that everyone experiences. Your body trembles, you sweat profusely, and you lose the ability to think clearly.\n\nMost of the time, however, my anxiety was barely perceptible — severe enough to impact my life but in a way that felt normal.\n\nOnce I became aware of the damaging effects of anxiety, I began trying solutions to target each source of it — worry, fear, and overwhelm.\n\nIt has now been over a year since I’ve struggled with insomnia or that adrenalin-fueled feeling of unease. These five tools have helped me get it under control.\n1. The 25-year reframe\n\nFor those of us who worry and experience subsequent anxiety, we tend to assign adverse events and outcomes more importance than they deserve. A rejection, a failure, or setback causes short term pain. But then we dwell on it. We play out worst-case scenarios and fret over the downstream effects.\n\nIn time, we realize our worst nightmares were cartoonish fantasies that never had any chance of materializing. With the benefit of hindsight, we understand all that worry and anxiety were a waste of time and energy.\n\nThe 25-year reframe speeds up that reconciliation. You gain the benefit of hindsight immediately instead of days, weeks, or months later. It works by allowing you to view that negative outcome through the lens of your future-self.\n\n    Close your eyes and imagine yourself 25 years into the future.\n    Evaluate today’s failure as though it were a distant memory that happened 25 years ago.\n    From that future perspective, will you remember today’s struggle? Was it so significant that it will have stuck with you all these years? Think about the arc of your life since then. How likely is it that you’ll remember this day?\n    If you do remember it, evaluate it with the benefit of 25 years distance. How significant was it? How did it affect where you ended up in life?\n    Picture yourself thinking about this experience. Are you laughing about it now? If so, why wait? Laugh about it now.\n\n2. The venomous unsent letter\n\nSo, your nemesis called you a name or your boss treated you like a child, or your not so friendly neighbors neglected to invite you to a party. Now, you’re angry.\n\nPerhaps you’re roaming the hallway, gripping the sides of your head like a vice, and allowing toxic thoughts to accumulate. You contemplate how you should have responded, and how you might get even.\n\nThe best way to move forward is to let it go. But we don’t. We hang onto it and suffer.\n\nHere’s a way out.\n\nCenturies ago, Benjamin Franklin wrote an angry letter to a friend of his in the British Parliament. Rather than send it, he shoved it into a drawer. The act of unloading his venomous tirade on paper relieved him of his anger.\n\nHe’s not the only historical figure to exploit the angry unsent letter. Abraham Lincoln called them hot letters. Mark Twain wrote them too.\n\nWhen someone says or does something that triggers you, don’t hold in the anger or scheme to get even. Take a deep breath, pull out a pen and piece of paper, and let loose on your nemesis.\n\nOnce you finish, read it, and rip it up; you’ll find the desire to seek revenge, even the score, or show them how stupid they are, diminishes to almost nothing.\n3. The experimenter’s ethos\n\nFear, especially when it’s hard to justify, causes anxiety because we beat ourselves up for letting it prevent us from pursuing our goals and dreams.\n\nIt’s warranted and even helpful to feel fear when a pack of hungry lions corners you, but it’s the irrational fear that’s problematic.\n\nI want to ask him out, but I’m afraid he’ll say no.\n\nI know I should call again to close that sale, but I’m afraid of how she’ll react.\n\nWhat makes it so infuriating and anxiety-producing, is that we know it’s irrational. We know it holds us back. Then we ruminate over our failure to overcome it.\n\nTo overcome irrational fear, you only need to trick your brain. This technique will sound silly. It’s almost embarrassing, but it works. You’re going to adopt the experimenter’s ethos.\n\nPicture yourself in a white lab coat, holding a clipboard. You’re running an experiment. The experiment is that thing you fear. As the experimenter, you remain unattached to a particular outcome. You’re only interested in producing a result for later analysis.\n\nImagine yourself holding that clipboard, ready to record the result. Then, take the action you fear. When it’s over, picture yourself logging the outcome onto your clipboard.\n\nIs it silly? Yes. But it works.\n4. The beach-comber philosophy\n\nThe beach-comber is a caricature of a carefree, uncaring, shiftless dude walking the beach with not a care in the world. That’s probably not the life you’d like to live.\n\nBut we can learn from the beach-comber and his philosophy. It can help you overcome that haunting feeling that the world has conspired to demand more than what you’re capable of giving.\n\nI feel so overwhelmed, we often say.\n\nThe key to overcoming overwhelm is cultivating the ability to say, I don’t give a shit — and mean it.\n\nWhen you feel like the world demands too damn much of you, take a deep breath. Get a pen and paper. Write out everything contributing to your overwhelm — obligations, criticism, and interpersonal struggles. For each one, ask yourself, “If I ignore this, what’s the worst that will happen? Can I live with that?”\n\nFor everything you answered, yes, say out loud, “I don’t give a shit.” Put it into your own words.\n\nTim’s been pressuring me to work instead of taking vacation days. You know what. Screw him. I don’t give a shit if it bothers him.\n\nFor anything you answered, no, write out a plan (a sentence or two) to tackle each item. In time, you’ll be able to do this exercise in your mind. You’ll identify right away all the trivial stuff that doesn’t matter.\n5. The sacred time elixir\n\nThomas Edison wrote that “The best thinking has been done in solitude. The worst has been done in turmoil.” But Edison didn’t live in the 21st century. Solitude itself doesn’t cut it anymore.\n\nThink of sacred time as mindful solitude — a disconnection from the world while engaging in activity that brings you peace and heightened awareness.\n\nFor thirty minutes a day, isolate yourself from other people, disconnect from technology, and engage in light exercise (walking, cycling). Free yourself of any production goals, and spend your time appreciating everything you have in life.\n\nDuring your thirty minutes, you’ll realize that whatever ills might be bothering you, don’t matter much. You’ll finish your session feeling refreshed and calm. You’ll come to appreciate it as your daily elixir to unease, stress, and worry.\nThe takeaway\n\nThese five techniques help you curb the triggers of anxiety.\n\n    The 25-year reframe — relieve yourself of worry and endless rumination.\n    The venomous unsent letter — unload your anger constructively.\n    The experimenter’s ethos — overcome fear.\n    The beach-comber’s philosophy — stop caring about meaningless crap.\n    The sacred time elixir — A catch-all stress reliever.",

        "title": "Having Anxiety Can Help You",
        "description": "I’ve had anxiety for all of my life. At worst, it’s disabling: I had to drop out of a college program, and had difficulty with simple tasks, like walking into a grocery store.\n\nI’m taking medication for my anxiety again, and feel like it’s finally under control. If you’re having severe anxiety, I’d 100% recommend talking to a medical professional about it.\n\nBut day-to-day, some things make everybody anxious. An important job interview. A test coming up. A date. Anxiety is your body sending you signals; if you listen, you may be better off.\n\nI know people who throw caution to the wind, and take off without a plan. They’re often frustrated because their devil-may-care attitude leaves them completely unprepared. However…\nAnxiety makes you prepared.\n\nI’ve always been the person who has Band-aids in my purse, or granola bars and bottled water in my backpack during a trip.\n\nAnxiety makes you work harder. If you’re worried about a test, you’ll study for it.\n\nI have long had anxiety over driving. Now, I know the best times of days to drive (not at rush hour, for starters), and where all the best places to stop are on a trip.\nAnxiety makes you detail-oriented.\n\nA lot of jobs require people to be conscientious. “Ehh, good enough” is no good when you’re checking a plane’s engines or taking care of patients in an ICU.\n\nA little bit of anxiety makes you check things twice, making sure you didn’t miss anything. Often, you’ll catch something you previously missed.\n\nThis can help you to more thoroughly study for a test or prepare for a promotion.\nAnxiety makes you cautious.\n\nI’ve avoided a lot of bad situations because I was anxious about them. Maybe I shouldn’t drive on that flooded street, I think, and turn around.\n\nI wear a helmet with my bicycle and wear a seat belt when I drive. I’m aware of my surroundings, and look out for my safety with power equipment.\n\nCan I avoid every hazard? Of course not. Some things are out of my control, and I could never blame anyone for something bad happening to them. But it pays to think about what could go wrong once in awhile, and be cautious.\nAnxiety makes you sympathetic.\n\nI’m much more sympathetic to people with mental illness, since I know how it feels. In my worst panic attacks, on one level I knew what was going on, but I still took a long time to calm down.\n\nI didn’t realize until I was in college that a lot of physical illnesses can be compounded by stress, too. I know I can get migraines no matter how calm I am, but if I’m stressed, I’m much more likely to get them. So I’m sympathetic when someone gets sick.\n\nLife is all about relationships, too. Being able to empathize with other people is important. Because of my anxiety, I tend to listen more than talk. Because I spent so much time thinking about things, I have a perspective on a lot of topics.\n\nSometimes people come to me advice about things that are bothering them, and I’m able to help. Most of the time, a solution is available, and it just takes some time and effort to work through.\n\nI wouldn’t wish anxiety on anybody, but it happens to all of us. When it does, try use it to your advantage. You may be surprised at what you can accomplish.",

Officially, that is.\n\nThere, psychiatrists use the CCMD-3, a different system of classifying disorders to the rest of the world, which commonly uses America’s DSM-5 or the WHO’s ICD-10. And Internet addiction is a recognised problem in their book.\n\nThe result is that, in China, it’s easier to get treatment for compulsive use of digital media. You can even go to a military-style ‘boot camp’ to work, exercise and socialise your way out of it. We don’t know if that’s the most effective clinical intervention, but it shows how seriously China takes the matter. Internet addiction is also high on the public health agenda in Japan and South Korea.\n\nA global problem?\n\nWestern psychologists have been writing about ‘internet addiction’ since the early days of the web in the mid-1990s. But in two decades since, studies have failed to reach an agreement on what it is, and how much of a problem it represents.\n\nSome authors talk about it in the language of dependency, using terms like craving, tolerance and withdrawal, as if the internet is a habit some people can’t kick, like heroin or gambling. Others use terms around impulse control, comparing problematic internet use to attention-deficit or obsessive-compulsive disorders, where hard-to-resist urges prompt behaviours.\n\nEvidence has been found for both types of processes in use of the internet. This may be because ‘using’ the internet covers a huge range of activities. Shopping, gambling, emailing, gaming, surfing and accessing pornography are all mentioned in early studies.\nIn the last decade, new uses have emerged that didn’t exist when internet addiction was first described: social media and streaming of web-based videos. And it doesn’t help that these platforms — which generally make money through selling advertising — are deliberately designed to be addictive, keeping you online so you see more ads.\n\nUppers or downers?\n\nAlso, each use taps into slightly different psychological — and neurological — processes. A time-limited special offer on a shopping site or a bonus in an online game might give you a dopamine hit — motivating you to seek the outcome and feel rewarded. On the other hand, an anonymous chat room you visit regularly that’s full of people you trust might produce an opiate-based sense of soothing.\n\nThese variations in definition and effect are probably why the evidence is mixed and no single process of internet ‘addiction’ has been identified.\n\nIt could also explain why some people argue that the whole issue is overblown and no different to anything that’s come before. They say internet addiction is the emperor’s new clothes, arguing that the web merely facilitates the expression of problematic behaviours that have long existed in one form or other (like shopping or compulsive porn use).\n\nTo quote British public health guru Sir Muir Gray on internet addiction, speaking in 2008: “some people can become dependent on anything”. Emperor’s new clothes\n\nThis old-new problem may be true for activities such as gambling. Ten years ago, if you wanted to place a bet, you walked to the betting shop and did it. Now, you pull up the app on your phone while on the train or in the pub.\n\nSimilarly, people have long felt depressed or anxious after comparing themselves to friends or celebrities — social media has just made that possible 24/7 with a wider range of people. (Several studies have also found that Fear of Missing Out — FoMO — is a key motivator for compulsive social media use.)\n\nSo, what can we say for sure about problematic internet use?\n\nWell, as addiction specialist Prof. Marcantonio Spada argues, we know three things: 1) some people lose control of their online activity; 2) this can often produce distress, including sadness and anxiety; 3) it can also cause problems in daily functioning — socially, professionally, or financially.\n\nBut is this a new condition, or just a digitally-facilitated expression of behaviour that’s existed for decades, even centuries? Would the ancient Greeks have compulsively played their dice games online if they’d had smartphones and 4G in 1000 B.C.? Perhaps.\nWhat lies beneath\n\nHowever, there does seem to be something underlying it all: a ‘general’ sense of using the internet as a means to escape reality and regulate negative emotions. People with ‘general’ problematic internet use tend to be socially isolated, with low self-esteem and few friendships, seeking online contact as a social surrogate but often just ‘lurking’ in places like chat rooms, or on social media, rather than proactively communicating with others.\n\nThis is not something that was possible before the internet, in the way that gambling, shopping, gaming and watching porn were. In these general cases, internet dependency is at the centre of the process and becomes, in the words of Canadian psychologist Richard Davis, “the individual’s lifeline to the outside world”. In that respect, it is something new, and different.\n\nGeneral ‘problematic internet use’ (as it has been called) correlates significantly with mental health problems — like depression or obsessional thinking — and abuse of drugs and alcohol. Most evidence seems to show these difficulties exist before the person develops a digital addiction. For example, drug abuse has been shown to impair impulse control, raising the risk of problematic online behaviour.\n\nThere is also some suggestion that digital addiction further damages mental health. Research from China showed that development of an internet use problem predicted worse mental health a year later. And a team of researchers in India has theorised that digital addictions prompted greater alcohol and drug use as people sought further escape from the stress of their online behaviour.\n\nGive us your feedback\n\nSo, we can imagine a feedback loop between mental health problems, digital addictions, and substance misuse which, once established, keeps itself going.\n\nIt may even get worse as digital activity, drugs or alcohol become short-term coping strategies for psychological distress, leading to more problems with mental health and addictive behaviour. To our knowledge, no one has researched this yet.\n\nThis state of general addiction might describe one end of a spectrum, but what about ‘average’ internet users? Well, you might already notice some tendencies in yourself towards compulsive use. And you can measure how ‘problematic’ that is by answering this short questionnaire:\n\nhttps://psychology-tools.com/test/internet-addiction-assessment\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nIf you think you might be creeping into the territory of digital addiction, then try some practical steps to change your behaviour. Set limits for your internet or smartphone time, monitor use with an app like Moment, and design goals for yourself. These could include using the web to bolster offline friendships or arrange activities face-to-face. If you’re really struggling with it, speak to your doctor, who will refer you to the right place.\n\nIn the UK, there is currently no provision of treatment for digital addictions on the National Health Service, because it is not a recognised disorder. However, when the WHO releases ICD-11 next year, it will include gaming addiction as a diagnosis — meaning treatment will need to be made available for that specific issue.\n\nIn the meantime, there’s always a place at the Chinese military boot camp.",

        "title": "There is no such thing as “internet addiction”?",
        "description": "“Internet addiction” is the latest threat to civilization, the drug consuming our children, the story that the traditional media love to warn us about.\n\nThe problem is that there is no evidence, nor has the medical profession identified any kind of pathology. There is, however, lack of discipline applied by parents and teachers, along with a device, the multifunctional, versatile smartphone.\n\nAre there people “addicted to the internet”? No. Regardless of how often we hear it, it does not exist, at least according to the American Psychiatric Association, which has refused for years to include this absurd invention despite the pressures of those trying to make money curing that supposed disorder. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has never included it in its International Classification of Diseases, and this is known to addiction specialists.\n\nAre there people who use the internet too much? Too much compared to what? There are possibly cases of overuse, as there were people who used to watch too much television or spent their time on a single activity. In the case of the smartphone, a person who looks at their device every few minutes, a symptom that seems to frighten some people, may be playing a game, communicating, monitoring the price of a share, watching the weather, looking at a map, taking or retouching a photograph, reading a newspaper or a book, listening to music, learning about French politics through a chatbot, looking at photos of friends, checking the time, buying a movie ticket, paying for parking ticket, booking a restaurant, consulting a train or plane ticket, translating a text, asking for a taxi, and a very long etc. Addicted to what exactly? To life?\n\nThe internet is a medium, not an activity as such, although many people who were born before the internet can’t see the difference. If you spend a lot of time gambling online, you may lose a lot of money, but what you will have, as any psychiatrist can certify, is an addiction to gambling, not an “addiction to the internet”. If you spend hours shopping on the internet, you may have an addiction to shopping, but in no way an “internet addiction”. Talking about “internet addiction” is as absurd as talking about “street addiction”: the internet is a vehicle, not a condition. We can talk about addictions to substances, behavioral addictions, and even how some behaviors that might lead to addiction can be develop through the internet, in the same way they used to be developed through other means; but not “internet addiction” as such. Please, stop the nonsense.\n\nWhat’s the problem with taking our smartphone out more than a certain number of times a day? Is it weird to feel uncomfortable when there is no access to the internet, when the internet is one of the most appropriate and convenient ways of relating to the world? For what stupid reason has a means of communication come to define me as “addicted”? Who are the crooks trying to make money by inventing a disease, and then offering cures and miracle therapies to cure it? What interest does a television channel have in defining smartphone use as an “addiction”, other than getting us to spend more time viewing their content?\n\nAre there addicts? Of course: people can develop an addiction to just about anything. Fortunately, however, they account for a very small percentage of the population. Are there any gambling addicts? Yes, there have always been, and possibly, the fact that it is now possible to gamble online, avoiding many of the previous social constraints, we may see an increase in the problem. Are there otakus who become obsessed with a game and stop going out or seeing people? Yes, but that is not a problem related to the internet as such, and much less internet addiction, and the term itself has lost almost all of the pejorative connotations it once had.\n\nAs parents we will have to be sure to teach our children that there is a time and a place for everything and that they must manage their priorities. They cannot play all day, they cannot spend all day catching up with their friends, and they cannot avoid certain obligations because they are doing more enjoyable things. We will have to teach them what our parents taught us: that it isn’t possible to play all day, or spend the whole visit to our grandparents looking out of the window and not saying a word. In short, upbringing.\n\nSome people seem to think that children can bring themselves up, or perhaps they just can’t be bothered. If the kids start acting up, stick a smartphone in front of them. Later on, they’ll complain that their children are “addicted”: no, what they are is ill-mannered.\n\nThese parents talk about “internet addiction” because that conveniently relieves them of the responsibility of bringing up their children: “I would, but I cannot, because they are addicts,” they say. Sure.\n\n“Internet addiction”? No such thing. The idea is totally stupid, a simplistic and reductionist idea, an atavistic reflex that we should put to sleep as fast as we can. Forget about “addiction” and learn to take advantage of technology, and teach your children how to do so too.",

        "title": "The Rise of Internet Addiction",
        "description": "During the 2000's and 2010's Internet Addiction has emerged as a major behavioural addiction, but what is it and how is it diagnosed?\n\nA formal definition or diagnosis for Internet Addiction (IA) does not exist as of 2018. One of the earliest attempts at defining Internet Addictive Disorder (IAD) was in a 1998 paper by Dr. Jonathan Kandell who described it thus;\n\n    “a psychological dependence on the Internet, regardless of the type of activity once logged on.” Kandell (1998)\n\nA sub-type of Internet Addiction, Internet Gaming Disorder was first recognised as a potential disorder in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V 2013) which described it as a condition warranting more research before it can be included as a formal disorder. While debate continues around the definition and classifications of Internet Addiction, some researchers have advanced their own proposals.\n\nIn Starcevic’s 2017 paper it was concluded the umbrella term Internet Addiction was too broad and overlooked important differences between the types of activity. Starcevic defined Internet Gaming Disorder and Internet Addiction as separate disorders (Starcevic and Billieux, 2017)\n\nIn 2015 Northrup et al. identified the term Internet Addiction as ’structurally problematic’, as the Internet is the just the medium which facilitates the addiction and does not describe the specific addictive processes. Northrup developed The Internet Process Addiction Test (IPAT) screening tool which uses an expanded classification of Internet Addictions thus;\n\n    Online video games\n    Social networking\n    Online sexual activity\n    Web surfing. (Northrup, Lapierre, Kirk, and Rae, 2015)\n\nHowever while considering these classifications, the role of the Internet as a facilitator should not be underestimated. The Internet introduces aggravating elements to the addiction process which would not be present in the real world analogue, such as ease of access, always-on availability, anonymity, and privacy. Furthermore, Northrup’s IPAT survey found a correlation which indicated that subjects with IA addictions suffered poor mental health.\n\nThe Emergence of Internet Addiction\n\nThe various forms of Internet Addiction can be traced back to a convergence of the addictive activity, and the development of the technology which facilitates the activity. For example, video game consoles were available in the 1980's, but only became Internet connected in the 2010's — the two technologies converged, and the addiction classification of Internet Gaming Disorder came into being.\n\n1980's — Video games, the early years\n\nVideo arcade games like Space Invaders and Pac Man were introduced to the public in the 1980's, and were the first of their genre. While playing these games did evoke some addictive tendencies, these were kept in check because the game machines were located in public arcades, and players had to deposit coins to play, which limited their playing time.\n\nTowards the mid 1980's, home video consoles such as the Atari 2600 allowed players to engage in a rudimentary version of their favourite arcade games in the comfort of their own home. Importantly, the Internet was still in early years of its development, so playing these console games was mostly a solitary activity.\n\nIn parallel, computer hardware and networking technology were evolving and becoming more affordable. During the 1980's Personal Computers were introduced into the workplace, they were generally used for office tasks, and were too expensive for a family to own in their home.\n\n1990's — The PC and the Internet converge\n\nDuring the 1990's, personal computers became more affordable and more powerful in terms of graphics capability and processing speed, this made them more attractive for families to own. The Internet was also becoming increasingly relevant and more accessible.\n\nInternet Service Providers like AOL offered easy ways to get online and surf the web, with basic ‘social networking’ activities like online chat rooms (Internet Relay Chat) and access to Email becoming widespread.\n\nThe Internet was accessed by cable using a dial-up modem, this resulted in the family PC generally being located in a public area of the house, like the kitchen, and shared by family members.\n\n2000's — Mobile phones become affordable\n\nThe turn of the millennium saw the introduction of affordable, but basic, mobile phones. Ownership increased throughout the decade in parallel with improvements in the hardware and accessibility to the Internet, although connection speeds were quite slow.\n\n2010's — Smartphones and the social network\n\nThe introduction of smartphones, like the Apple iPhone, marked a turning point in how the Internet was used. For the first time people had a personal portable device which offered the power and usability of a home PC combined with ubiquitous access to the Internet. People could engage in any type of Internet activity, anonymously, at the time and place of their choosing.\n\nThe social network increased its penetration, more people signed up to networks like Facebook and Twitter and engaged in online social interactions with their family and friends.\n\nGamers were not left behind during this revolution. Gaming consoles like the Sony PS4 and Microsoft XBox provided incredible processing power and photorealistic graphics. Combined with high-speed Internet connections gamers could compete in online battles against other gamers, while conversing in a ’social network’ with their friends.\n\nThe immersive experience of online Internet Gaming, and compulsive interaction with social media (the ’fear of missing out’ concept) helped generate addictive behaviours of a type never seen before.\n\nHow Much of a Problem is Internet Addiction?\n\nStudies attempting to estimate rates of Internet Addiction in a population tend to vary wildly, mainly because the term is not clearly defined, and diagnostic and measurement techniques not agreed on.\n\nHowever, Internet Addiction as a general concept definitely exists and the addictions are causing problematic behaviours. The rate of addiction can only increase as access to the Internet becomes available in undeveloped countries. There are massive populations of people who are not yet online, but Global internet companies are extending their reach to tap into these markets and ensure everybody is connected.\n\nAge is becoming less of a barrier to Internet usage and the resulting addictive behaviours. Young children have access to Wi-fi connected tablets, the basic interface of these devices means even pre-schoolers quickly learn how to engage in online gaming and social media activities like viewing YouTube videos.\n\nFurther Research\n\nA literature meta-analysis undertaken in 2014 supports Northrup’s findings in relation to mental health. Significant associations were found between Internet Addiction and ADHD, depression and anxiety (Ho, Zhang, Tsang, Toh, Pan, Lu, Cheng, Yip, Lam, Lai, Watanabe, and Mak, 2014) The study concluded that further studies to understand relationships between Internet Addiction and psychiatric co-morbidities would help in the development of mental health services in this area.\n\nOur understanding of the types of Internet Addiction, the mechanisms which drive these addictive processes, and the tests and diagnostic processes are becoming clearer, which should result in the development of effective treatment programmes.\n\nHowever, unlike other areas of addiction, Internet technology and the development of computer hardware devices is progressing at an rapid pace. It is therefore essential for Psychiatric and Psychology researchers to stay informed of developments and anticipate future directions of the technology in order to identify and plan for new types of addiction as they emerge.",

        "title": "5 types Internet Addiction",
        "description": "What Is an Internet Addiction?\n\nToday, internet and computer use are ingrained in contemporary society and have changed the way we live our lives more than any other technological medium yet. Despite this, we still know relatively little about the effects of internet addiction on our psychological functioning, mental health, and general well-being. Just last year, data from the Pew Research Center showed that 77% of Americans connect to the internet on a daily basis. While many believe that surfing the web or binging cat videos on YouTube is a relatively harmless act, there are some people who spend so much of their time using a computer or on the internet that it has begun to interfere with their daily lives. When an action or desire becomes a hindrance, taking precedence over the most important aspects of one’s life – relationships, work, school – it can become classified as an addiction.\n\nInternet addiction is yet to be listed in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (commonly referred to as the DSM-5). However, a 2-year study funded by The National Institutes of Health may change that. Beginning in August of 2017, the study could deliver sufficient evidence that problems stemming from excessive internet use deserve serious attention from U.S. mental health and psychiatric communities. Professionals that do recognize internet addiction tend to classify it as either an obsessive-compulsive disorder or an impulse control disorder to aid treatment. Internet addiction is also called compulsive computer use, pathological internet use, and internet dependence.\n5 Types of Internet Addiction\n\nInternet addiction is a broad term that covers a range of behaviors and impulse-control problems involving internet, personal computer, and mobile technology. While there is yet no officially accepted criteria to diagnose an internet addiction, researchers have identified 5 subcategories of specific types of computer and internet addictions.\nCybersex Addiction\n\nA Cybersex addiction is one of the more self-explanatory internet addictions. It involves online pornography, adult websites, sexual fantasy/adult chat rooms, and XXX web-cam services among others. An obsession with any of these services can be harmful to one’s ability to form real-world sexual, romantic, or intimate relationships. Treatment options are available for those with cybersex addictions, typically in the form of intervention followed by ongoing inpatient or outpatient therapy.\nNet Compulsions\n\nNet compulsions concern interactive activities online that can be extremely harmful, such as online gambling, trading stocks, online auctions (such as E-bay), and compulsive online shopping. These habits can have a detrimental impact on one’s financial stability and disrupt job-related duties. Spending or losing excessive amounts of money can also cause stress in one’s relationships. With instant and easy access to online casinos and stores, it is easy for those who are already susceptible to a gambling or spending addiction to get hooked online.\nCyber (Online) Relationship Addiction\n\nCyber or online relationship addicts are deeply involved with finding and maintaining relationships online, often forgetting and neglecting real-life family and friends. Typically, online relationships are formed in chat rooms or different social networking sites but can occur anywhere you can interact with people online. Often, people who pursue online relationships do so while concealing their real identity and appearance – this modern phenomena led to the creation of the term “catfish.”\n\nAfter being consumed by an online social life and persona, a person may be left with limited social skills and unrealistic expectations concerning in-person interactions. Many times, this leads to an inability to make real-world connections, in turn, making them more dependent on their cyber relationships. Counseling or therapy is typically required to treat this addiction and ensure lasting behavioral changes.\nCompulsive Information Seeking\n\nThe internet provides users with a wealth of data and knowledge. For some, the opportunity to find information so easily has turned into an uncontrollable urge to gather and organize data. In some cases, information seeking is a manifestation of pre-existing, obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Commonly, compulsive information-seeking can also reduce work productivity and potentially lead to job termination. Depending on the severity of the addiction, treatment options can range from different therapy modalities – which target changing compulsive behavior and developing coping strategies – to medication.\nComputer or Gaming Addiction\n\nComputer addiction, sometimes referred to as computer gaming addiction, involves on- and offline activities that can be done with a computer. As computers became more widely available, games such as Solitaire, Tetris, and Minesweeper were programed into their software. Researchers quickly found that obsessive computer game playing was become a problem in certain settings. Office employees would spend excessive amounts of time playing these games causing a notable decrease in productivity. Today, not only are these classic games still available, but so are thousands of new ones. Computer addiction is the oldest type of internet/computer addiction, and it is still prevalent and harmful today.\n",

        "title": "5 Incredible Lessons From Billionaire Ray Dalio To Make Better Decisions?",
        "description": "There are approximately 2825 billionaires, but only a handful go around the world sharing the wisdom they have gained from their life and professional experience. One of them is Ray Dalio.\n\nFour months ago, I hadn’t even heard of the guy, but I can now certainly say that stealing certain methods from his playbook has impacted the way I perceive life events. In his TED talk, Dalio recounted how he used to be an arrogant jerk in his mid-20s, and traversing through multiple cycles of falling and rising helped him understand how the world truly worked.\n\nIn over five decades, Ray has amassed immense professional success and personal gratification. He says his life’s mission now is to share as much knowledge as he can with the world. Heck, the guy has made his content free on his personal website, or his Youtube Channel.\n\nI’ve now become quite a big fan of his work and his life principles, and I’m not trying to hide the fact either. Here are five important takeaways after reading through his work.\nDo yourself a favor: Get out of your head\n\nIf there’s one lesson Dalio wants us to learn, it’s this: True success lies in embracing reality and bursting your own delusion. There’s a world inside our head, and then there’s one actually out there. Both could be starkly different, yet we barely recognize that.\n\nIt looks obvious in theory, but it’s the hardest one in practice. People like to live in their own worlds. They look at things the way they want to, not how they really are. And I’ve myself been guilty of this — creating expectations that differ from reality.\n\nBy evolution, humans are wired to be reluctant to change. It used to give us an advantage before, but now this attribute of ours is incoherent with the fast-changing world of today. 80% of people still bat an eye when it comes to making money online. They still consider pursuing a “stable job” in a large multinational as a “real profession”. They choose to neglect the reality — half the reasons which tilted the balance in favor of real jobs in the pre-internet era, simply don’t exist anymore.\nI would often get feedback from a close friend: I was an idealist. I looked at the “What should be” than “What is.”\n\nI do believe the world needs idealists because they dream what no one else does. But if you’re an idealist who lives in a bubble, with little or no understanding of the ground reality, you can hardly make any significant change in your life or others’ lives. Unsolicited idealism is just another disguise of procrastination.\n\n    Instead of faking your life through positive self-talk and self-manipulation, don’t you think accepting the reality of your flaws and working on them will leave you better off in the long run?\n\nRay Dalio believes that we all are limited by our biases and perceptions. To counter these, he recommends surrounding yourself with a group of people who look at things differently, hence helping you look at reality more clearly. And the better you understand reality, the greater your chances are to make the most out of it, by either accepting it or knowing how and what to change.\nTakeaways\n\n    Constantly take feedback from those around you. Try to make quick feedback loops for rapid improvement.\n    Play your own Devil’s advocate. When you look at something, always try to counter your original presumption. This makes your perspective more nuanced.\n\nPain + reflection = progress\n\nLet’s break this one down because it’s an interesting and honest take at learning from our mistakes.\n\nFailing is painful. When you try things, you stumble and fail. And this failure may cause opportunity cost, capital cost, or some humiliation (social cost).\n\nDalio faced an especially public humiliation when he placed a bet against the US economy and failed, losing most of his money, his clients, and business, eventually borrowing $4,000 from his dad to stay above water.\n\nHowever, pain by itself doesn't create any progress. We romanticize the masochistic definition of success. We believe pain causes progress.\n\nDalio suggests that unless we take the time out to reflect on why we failed and what our weak areas are, going through that process of pain isn’t of much significance.\n\n    “Reflection is one of the most underused yet powerful tools for success.” — Richard Carlson\n\nReflecting on our performance and flaws leads to progress and prepares us to solve future problems effectively.\nVisualizing everything as a machine\n\nAs I perused the content on macroeconomics (books and reports) prepared by Ray Dalio and his associates, I realized that he visualizes everything as a moving machine with working parts.\n\nThese parts work together to create a result. These parts may wear over time. When they do, you need to repair the machine with the right tools, and you may need to consult experts to understand what is causing the problem.\n\nIn the same vein, consider adopting a scientific approach to life. A lot of people think of life as an abstract concept whose problems cannot be solved using the tools they use to solve problems in industry or academia. They can’t be more wrong. They are lazy, who don’t try to figure out the cause-effect relationship of things in their lives.\n\n    If you’re really so smart, why aren’t you happy? ~ Naval Ravikant\n\nRay Dalio is one of the first thought leaders to visualize the Economy as a machine with moving and interacting parts. His explanation of how the economy works is the most straightforward and simplest I’ve seen.\n\nThe scientific approach has helped me a lot of times in making decisions. And it is simple, it simply involves isolating and looking at what affects certain things in life. Our life is just a function of our environment and our actions. Nothing else.\n\nFor example, your performance in that interview last week wasn’t bad because you were “not good” or “not lucky”. Maybe you didn’t get a good sleep the last night, maybe the intense pressure erodes your performance, maybe your preparation was fine, but you just weren’t prepared for the one question they asked in the interview.\n\nA scientist’s approach involves looking at the minuscule details to find flaws.\n\nIt involves looking at the input:\n1. Effort invested in the interview preparation\n2. Amount of sleep taken\n3. Guidance taken from mentors and friends\n4. Your mood on that day\n5. The weather, and a hundred other things, etc.\n\nAnd correlating that with the outputs by asking questions like:\n- What exact question in the interview did you mess up?\n- What went wrong while you were answering it?\n- Would it be different if you tried again? How?\n\nAdopting and following this process is messy and takes time, but it sure is rewarding in the long run.\nCrush your ego\n\nDalio explains that we humans haven’t evolved to look objectively at our own weaknesses. The Fight-or-Flight mechanism compels us to react negatively to any sort of negative feedback. This, in turn, hurts our chance to improve.\n\nIt induces the fear that we’re not good enough, hence we’re not important and we don’t matter. Humans crave praise. Hence, we develop an ego, to safeguard ourselves from the world.\n\nBut it’s just another manifestation of us trying to live inside our own bubbles, distorted from reality.\n\n    Leave your ego at the door every morning, and just do some truly great work. Few things will make you feel better than a job brilliantly done. — Robin Sharma\n\nYou don’t need to know everything. No one can know everything. So if ego is the thing that stops you from taking feedback or help from others, realize that it’s always better to take some help and make great things, than work alone and reach nowhere.\nTaking feedback the right way\n\nThis one caused me an “Oh damn” moment. In the past, whenever I would get feedback from others, I tended to focus on the conclusions they arrived at. I would often miss out on the process and perspectives they would come to arrive at that conclusion. And I’ve seen others suffer from the problem.\n\nWe have been taking feedback the wrong way. If someone in your workplace calls you out for being a sucky team member, don’t fret over it. Because the conclusion someone makes about you can be completely wrong. In fact, odds are high that it will be wrong. After all, they are human too. We as a species suck a lot at making rational judgments.\n\nDalio explains that conclusions are irrelevant. What matters is to understand the other person’s observation. How do they look at things? Why are they looking at it in a way that’s different from yours? When you do this, it fills the gaps in your observation and gives you a more complete picture of a situation.\n\nNo one can look at reality completely. Some see details, others see big pictures. Some are linear thinkers, others are more lateral. By borrowing what others think of a situation, you are basically borrowing observation data points. And the greater the number and diversity of opinions (or data points) you have, the better your judgment will be.\n\nHence, we all have blind spots, and when we look at things from other people’s perspectives, our overall perception gains more nuance, and our blind spots are removed.\nFinal thoughts\n\nMaking change takes time. Life doesn't change in a day. And if it did, it would be less fun anyway. It takes a great amount of effort to develop better habits. Here’s a summary of what I covered in this story, so you can take it and start applying it right away:\n\n    Get out of your head. Seriously. Your world view can be different from what actually the world is. The way to get out of this bubble is by countering your initial bias and questioning your beliefs. Having a group of people who question your beliefs also helps to develop a balanced view.\n    Is “No Pain, no Gain” might be true, but it isn’t complete. Without proper self-reflection, no amount of pain endurance will cause progress. Hence,\n    Pain + Reflection = Progress\n    Visualize everything as a machine. Every outcome in life is a result of certain input. Figuring out what drives the life-machine takes time and persistence, but once you do find it out, it leads to progress.\n    Crush your ego. You can’t know everything, and the good thing is neither can anybody else. So why not take external help and become better? You can give 100% when working alone. You can give much more when working with others.\n    Take feedback the right way. Focus on your critics’ perspectives and not their conclusions. More specifically, figure their “why” not “what”. Their final judgment can be flawed, cause they are human too. But their observation may help fill the gap left in yours.",
        "summary": "So if ego is the thing that stops you from taking feedback or help from others, realize that it’s always better to take some help and make great things, than work alone and reach nowhere. I’ve now become quite a big fan of his work and his life principles, and I’m not trying to hide the fact either. Four months ago, I hadn’t even heard of the guy, but I can now certainly say that stealing certain methods from his playbook has impacted the way I perceive life events. Instead of faking your life through positive self-talk and self-manipulation, don’t you think accepting the reality of your flaws and working on them will leave you better off in the long run? Dalio suggests that unless we take the time out to reflect on why we failed and what our weak areas are, going through that process of pain isn’t of much significance. To counter these, he recommends surrounding yourself with a group of people who look at things differently, hence helping you look at reality more clearly. But if you’re an idealist who lives in a bubble, with little or no understanding of the ground reality, you can hardly make any significant change in your life or others’ lives. Pain + reflection = progress\n\nLet’s break this one down because it’s an interesting and honest take at learning from our mistakes. And the better you understand reality, the greater your chances are to make the most out of it, by either accepting it or knowing how and what to change. A lot of people think of life as an abstract concept whose problems cannot be solved using the tools they use to solve problems in industry or academia. Maybe you didn’t get a good sleep the last night, maybe the intense pressure erodes your performance, maybe your preparation was fine, but you just weren’t prepared for the one question they asked in the interview. You can give much more when working with others. Do yourself a favor: Get out of your head\n\nIf there’s one lesson Dalio wants us to learn, it’s this: True success lies in embracing reality and bursting your own delusion.",

        "title": "The Practicality Behind Accepting Things You Cannot Change",
        "description": "Accepting things you cannot change is one of the most practical things you can do.\n\nWhy? Because the energy you would use to try to change something you cannot change can be put to better use in order to mold the kind of life you truly want to live.\n\nOver the years, I’ve come across many adages and philosophies that embody the concept of accepting things you cannot change. Reinhold Niebuhr prayed:\n\n    “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.”\n\nThis is a practical prayer, probably one of the most practical prayers I’ve ever heard because it tells you how to deal with obstacles and uncertainty in your life with 3 main steps:\n\n    First, and the most important, it tells you to look to the Most High — to take a humble stance.\n    It informs you that there are things you cannot change and things you can change-things you have power over and things you don’t have power over.\n    And it’s important to know the difference.\n\nStoicism is built on the similar tenet of dichotomy of control which states there are things that are in your power and things that are not in your power. Circumstances(on a wholesale level) are a great example of something that is not in your control.\n\nCircumstances may not be in your power but your reaction to circumstances are in your power.\n\nFor example, suppose there’s bad weather. It’s raining and you hate the rain. You can complain about the rain or you can grab an umbrella. Your attitude towards the rain-grabbing the umbrella-makes it easier to weather(no pun intended).\n\nIn the book “The Law Of Attraction” by Esther and Jerry Hicks, accepting things you cannot change is called “the art of allowing” which says that you should allow people to choose what they want while you go your own way or else you’ll make what they’re choosing your point of attraction.\n\nYour point of attraction is what you focus on. And the more your focus on that point of attraction the more of it you get.\n\nFor example, if you focus on all the bad in the world, you’re only going to keep seeing more of the bad in the world. Instead of focusing on the bad, it’s advantageous to focus on the good.\n\nOptimism doesn’t mean that you’re embracing naïveté. It’s acknowledging all that is right despite all that is wrong, bad or outside our preferences.\n\nWe came into this life experience to carve out the kind of life we want to live with limited control. There’s no use in wasting the energy we’ve been given on things that are immovable.\n\nIt’s much more practical to work on the things we directly impact.",

        "title": "Why Listening is a Skill Everyone Needs to Master",
        "description": "Throughout my life I was trained how to speak—elocutions, public speaking, group discussions, debates, and so on. But I was never taught nor have I heard of someone learn “listening” formally.\n\nOne reason could be because speaking is tangible—unlike listening—it makes more noise, quite literally, thus attracts more attention as a skill.\n\nBut listening is as important as speaking is. It is an overlooked skill, both in personal and professional lives. As we shall see, it is one of the most important skills you need to master, and it also lays the foundation for other important skills too.\nListening Builds Trust\n\nPeople are full of ideas, experiences, and emotions—they love to talk about them. And always look for others who can listen.\n\nWhile most people are excellent in talking, only a few are good listeners. Hence there is a deficiency for listeners. Hence when people come across good listeners they value them.\n\nActive listening is when you pay attention to every word the other person says, maintaining eye contact, nodding promptly to acknowledge that you’re listening, and asking specific doubts to be sure you fully understand them. When you do this to someone, the other person would certainly like you, even if it’s a stranger.\n\nWhen you listen to someone, you give them your time and undivided attention—nothing can be more attractive than those two combined. And subconsciously they start trusting you and would open up more, even their personal stuff. The more the other person talks about their personal stuff, the more they trust you.\n\nBe it family, friends, colleagues, customer, or strangers—actively listening to people is the quickest way to build trust.\nBuilding Empathy through Listening\n\nListening is not only done with your ears, but also with your eyes, mind, and the entire body.\n\nListening has been misunderstood that it’s just hearing to the words the other person utters, but it’s more than that. When a person talks, they give more non-verbal cues than verbal ones. The ups and downs in their voice, how fast or slow they talk, facial expressions, the way their hands move, and the entire body language.\n\nWords only help us understand what the other person says, but combining it with non-verbal cues tells what the other person is experiencing or feeling. That’s when you listen one hundred per cent. And you develop what is called empathy—you get into their shoes of the other person and understand the world as they experience it.\n\nActive listening is the primary way to empathise with others and can help you in having better relationships with people. Also, empathy lays the foundation to develop emotional intelligence.\nListening and Emotional Intelligence\n\nIn short, emotional intelligence is the ability to clearly label emotions and deciding when to give importance to a particular emotion and when not to.\n\nListening plays a crucial role in developing emotional intelligence. When you actively listen to someone, you empathise with them and understand their emotions. And as you consciously practice this, you’ll be able to specifically identify their emotions — excited, anxious, furious, embarrassed, intimidated, etc.\n\nDoing this for over a period of time, you not only learn to identify other’s emotions but also yours. You’ll be able to clearly label and emotion when you experience it, the first part of emotional intelligence. And this is really important to decide whether the emotion needs attention or not, the second part.\n\nEmotional Intelligence is the key to effective relationships, collaboration, teamwork, and leadership—some of the skills everyone should possess. And the good thing is you can start building emotional intelligence by becoming a better listener.\nListening Makes You an Open-Minded Person\n\nHave you ever actively listened to someone who completely disagrees with you? And not listening not for the sake of it, but with an intent to understand the other person. If you did, you probably are open-minded.\n\nWe often cut someone in the middle while they talk, especially if we disagree with them. It’s always tempting to shove our ideas on others, without even waiting to understand their world view. And our world view is in no way superior to others. At times the other person may not be right, but it’s ok to listen to them, you might learn something you were previously unaware of.\n\nIt’s not a coincidence that great leaders are great listeners. They know listening to others is one way to learn more and the fact that brilliant ideas can come from anyone. This makes them more open-minded—one of the reasons why they became great leaders in the first place.\n\nOur worldviews are not always right—it will have gaps, inconsistencies, subjectivity, and crude assumptions. Only by actively listening to others we constantly expose ourselves to different ideas and beliefs—especially those that are different from ours—and thereby improving our own worldview.\n\nYou could have many “why didn’t I think of this?” moments and creative ideas when you listen to others. That’s when you realise you can learn from anyone and everyone, in other words, you become open-minded.\nConclusion\n\nIf you google “most important skills for the future,” you’ll find at least a million articles. And you’ll find these skills in most of them—empathy, emotional intelligence, collaboration, people management, effective communication, etc. Because these skills cannot be automated and need a human being to do it.\n\nListening has an important role to play in all these skills. And if you want to learn them, listening is the right place to start. Become a great listener and gain your edge in the future.",

        "title": "How to Stop Being so Forgetful",
        "description": "Last Friday night, I forgot to close the patio door of my home and my 2 indoor cats proceeded to run away.\n\nIf you know me personally, read my work, or follow me on any social platform, you’d know why how much of a fundamental crisis this was. We only noticed about 45 minutes later, so after 3.5 hours of frantic searching and another 3 hours of praying, our fur babies came back home.\n\nI am not the first person in the world to make this mistake. Except this particular one was the drop that spilled the glass.\n\nIn the past two weeks, I lost my spare car keys, my credit card, and forgot my lunch at home (twice). I misplaced my phone in my closet, a kitchen knife in the fridge, and my work keys in a bathroom. When I did end up finding the keys, I proceeded to then lock them in my office (and consequently, lock myself out).\n\nForgetfulness happens to the best of us. But what do you do when it happens so often that it consumes such a large amount of your time, and leads to mortifying consequences in your life? When do you decide enough is just goddamn enough?\n\nLike any sane person, I frantically Googled my behavior in order to pinpoint exactly which disorder I had. Turns out I could have GAD, Disorganized OCD, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, or some form of mania — with adult ADHD taking first place.\n\nExcept none of this made sense.\n\nI’m an anxious person from time to time, but I am highly functional. I obsess over certain things, but nothing out of the norm. And while an adult showing symptoms of ADHD can be highly forgetful and distracted, none of the other dominant symptoms (disorganization, hoarding clutter, having trouble keeping a schedule) rang true.\n\nI never miss a work deadline. I’m never late (to the important things). I’m the person who remembers to bring toothpaste on the trip. I keep an incredibly efficient schedule. If I’m so organized in my everyday life, why does everything I touch disappear like it just crossed the Bermuda Triangle?\n\nWhy am I so forgetful all the damn time? Well…\n1. Forgetfulness is a side effect.\n\nAs it turns out, forgetfulness is caused by a ton of different factors, usually at the root of a greater cause. More importantly, it can be “cured”. Once you discover exactly what is the initial cause of your diversion, you proceed to eradicate it.\n\nForgetfulness is caused by distraction. One does not go without the other. And both forgetfulness and distraction are caused by a plethora of things, including stress, health habits, and psychosomatic symptoms.\n\nFor example, experiencing particular stress this week could’ve caused me to be periodically distracted. Because anxiety kickstarts our stress response — otherwise known as ‘fight or flight’ — we are acutely aware of and reactive to danger, according to Jim Folk, M.D.\n\nHowever, this also reduces our ability to concentrate and focus.\n\nIt could also be the cumulative effects of growing up with an iPhone under my thumb, growing accustomed to the constant distraction and immediate gratification it provides. This has been proven to radically shorten our attention spans and make it incredulously harder to focus for long bouts of time.\nIt could even be low blood sugar, the effects of the flu, or PCOS.\n\nYou see, the message here is that just because your brain is jumping from one thing to the next, doesn’t mean you’re stupid, careless, or suffering from a disorder: it simply means there is another issue at hand.\n\nAnd luckily, like most issues — it can be reversed.\n2. Forgetfulness can be cured.\n\nA quick Google search will tell you that forgetfulness can be cured if only you were concentrated.\n\nGee, thanks, Google. Did you really think I didn’t know that?\n\nIt is indeed a fact that people notice less of their background environment when they concentrate exclusively on the task at hand. In turn, this allows them to make fewer mistakes and yield proper results.\n\nExcept the problem isn’t knowing what to do; it’s rather learning how to do it. Like every good habit you wish to build, the key is to develop mental tips and tricks that allow you to effectively produce the desired outcome over time.\n\nActively reducing your stress, getting quality rest, and taking care of your general health can significantly reduce — if not entirely eliminate — your inattentiveness. When your body snaps out of sustained stress, distraction disappears, and focus returns.\nMethods That Work\n\nMy stepfather is both a trained pilot and an ex-military man. Trust me when I tell you that nothing builds a new habit like a military regime does.\n\nThis is why when I became desperate to find a measure that flipped my forgetfulness around, I turned to the intricate connection between military-reinforced habit building and psychological techniques.\n“One Man, One Kit”\n\nThis technique is not one you’ll find on a quick Google search. The ‘One Man, One Kit’ Method basically means: if you can’t carry it, don’t bring it.\n\nAs an avid minimalist, not only do I love this maxim, but I love what it implies. You are responsible for your own things — no borrowing, no forgetting, no excess.\n\nIt originates from the Royal Canadian Army, where cadets are given one “kit” upon arrival — including clothes, basic accessories, and a hygiene kit — which they’re responsible for maintaining in order. If they’re disorganized and lose an item, too bad. And inevitably, you don’t want to be losing your things as an army cadet.\n\nSo how can you apply it? I now have a “launchpad” before leaving the house; all of my essential things are there. Luckily, I don’t have too much clutter, so I know exactly what my essentials are.\n\nIf this is not your case, I advise you to declutter your space and create a location where you can place everything you need and cannot forget for the next day. This way, if you’re searching for your keys, you know you’ll have actively placed them in the bowl at the entrance.\n\nNot in your pockets, not in your car, and definitely not in your fridge (sadly, this has happened to me more than I’d like to admit).\n\nEverything has a place, and there’s a place for everything. If that’s all you focus on, you’ll already have improved by far.\nThe Crew Resource Management Method\n\nMy personal favorite is the Crew Resource Management Method (CRM), created initially for Royal Air Force pilots as a way to improve aviation safety. CRM is a set of training procedures used in environments where human error can have devastating effects, such as on a flight (or when your cats run away).\n\nHave you ever heard of the saying, ‘A plane is most likely to crash within the first 8 minutes of taking flight or landing’? Well, there’s a reason for that.\n\nThe term CRM was first coined in 1979 by NASA psychologist John Lauber who studied communication processes in cockpits for years. After coming to the conclusion that copilots who engaged in chit-chat that was irrelevant to aircraft procedures when the plane was between 0 and 10 000 feet in the air and/or didn’t follow a specific checklist — even if they knew it by heart — were more likely to make devastating mistakes than those who didn’t.\n\nTherefore, there are quite a few interesting takeaways from this method. When you’re doing a specific task, whether it be writing an article or simply unlocking the door to your office, focus solely on what you’re doing.\n\nIf your phone rings, let it go to voicemail. If you’re carrying 85 things in your hands, put something down and make two trips. The more you slow down and reduce external stimuli, the more you’ll pay attention to the little things — and the less margin you’ll leave for error.\n\nWe also learned that mastering concentration is difficult, even for army pilots. It requires significant changes in your personal and interpersonal habits, as well as your organizational culture.\n\nAs you are both the creator and receiver of your thoughts, make sure to be mindful of the way you speak to yourself and who you surround yourself with.\n\nCalling yourself stupid, being around disorganized people, or continuing to go about your day absent-minded and with no significant system won’t help you improve your focus in any way.\n\nAnd lastly, we can also take away that checklists are essential to everyone — we are all human, after all, and therefore prone to error. Accept it, build a system, and work with it.\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBeing forgetful is not only troublesome, but it’s frustrating as hell. Changing my credit card and updating my billing info everywhere for the third time this month was a nuisance. Losing my cats was heartbreaking.\n\nAnd we all have better things to do with our time than look for where we misplaced our phone and keys.\n\nCareless mistakes are part of life, but if it’s gotten to the point where it disturbs your everyday wellbeing, don’t lose hope — you can do something about it.\n\nThe power of your mind always supersedes your actions. The more a particular thought or belief is activated and reinforced, the stronger the neural pathways in your mind become, and the more you perceive these thoughts as true.\n\nInstead of thinking of yourself as careless, distracted, or broken, think of yourself as all of the things you wish you’d be. And before you know it, alongside a little help from your habits: watch yourself grow into that exact person.",

        "title": "How to Use the KonMari Method to Declutter and Improve Your Life",
        "description": "Have you ever felt stuck at your job? Stuck with a friend who no longer shares your values and ties you down? Stuck in a lackluster relationship?\n\nI’ve felt stuck in all three of these categories, but I’ve learned to tidy up my life and seek out that which brings me joy. Making a career change and terminating some relationships has dramatically improved my life.\n\nMarie Kondo is an organizational guru. She has a show on Netflix and wrote a book, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, explaining her process. Rather than cleaning the house by location, the KonMari Method involves tidying up in five categories:\n\n    Clothes\n    Books\n    Papers\n    Komono (miscellaneous items)\n    Sentimental items\n\nMoving down the list, Kondo encourages her clients to gather all items within a category into one location. The client is then to hold each individual item and consider whether it sparks joy. If an item fails to spark anything less than joy, clients are to thank it for its service and then gently place it in a garbage bag or donation pile.\n\nThe KonMari method emphasizes being mindful and introspective. This approach stems from the principle that if something does not spark joy, you do not need it in your home. It’s just clutter lying around taking up space and leaving you indifferent or miserable.\n\nI argue that this same method could be used to de-clutter and improve your life. Here are my categories:\n\n    Job/Career\n    Friends\n    Romantic relationships\n\nEvaluate whether any of these categories is a source of dissatisfaction in your life. If something doesn’t spark joy, it’s time to tidy up. The KonMari website lists six rules to follow when tidying: (1) Commit yourself to tidying up. (2) Imagine your ideal lifestyle. (3) Finish discarding first. (4) Tidy by category, not location. (5) Follow the right order. (6) Ask yourself if it sparks joy.\n\n    Commit yourself to tidying not just your space, but your life. Living a joyful and meaningful life means eliminating that which doesn’t help you pursue your own happiness or goals.\n    Imagine your ideal lifestyle. Do you want a career that allows you to travel the world? Do you want to become a renowned author? Whatever your dream lifestyle, surround yourself with people who will help you get there or be supportive as you take the appropriate steps.\n    Finish discarding first. Think deeply before deciding to let go of a career or relationship. If there are measures which can be taken to fix things, by all means, try to fix them first. But if you’re absolutely unhappy and there is nothing salvageable, then perhaps it’s time to learn from your experiences and move forward with your life.\n    Tidy by category, not location. Focus on one area of your life at a time. If you try to change too much at once, there could be negative consequences such as alienating your loved ones or burning bridges at work.\n    Follow the right order. I say start with your career first because there’s less emotion involved than ending a friendship. Additionally, a 2016 Pew Research Center survey shows that 30 percent of American workers view the work they do as “just a job to get them by.” Having a fulfilling career that sparks joy can shift your mindset from dreading the day to embracing each morning. This shift in perspective can help improve your personal relationships.\n    Ask yourself if the relationship sparks joy. In your job, does the work itself or the people you work with spark joy? Do you dread a friend’s phone call because they only reach out when they need something? Does a date with your partner feel more like an obligation than something you look forward to doing? If you don’t feel joy in the things you do, it might be worth considering cutting ties.\n\nIt may sound challenging to switch careers and harsh to end relationships with people you care about. But doing this in my own life has opened up so many possibilities and led to me being happier than ever.\nJob/Career\n\nMarie Kondo released a book this year titled Joy at Work. The publisher’s summary describes the novel as helpful in eliminating clutter in the workplace and enjoying productivity and success.\n\n    The workplace is a magnet for clutter and mess. Who hasn’t felt drained by wasteful meetings, disorganized papers, endless emails, and unnecessary tasks? These are the modern-day hazards of working, and they can slowly drain the joy from work, limit our chances of career progress, and undermine our well-being.\n\n    There is another way. In Joy at Work, best-selling author and Netflix star Marie Kondo and Rice University business professor Scott Sonenshein offer stories, studies, and strategies to help you eliminate clutter and make space for work that really matters.\n\n    Using the world-renowned KonMari Method and cutting-edge research, Joy at Work will help you overcome the challenges of workplace mess and enjoy the productivity, success, and happiness that come with a tidy desk and mind.\n\nEliminating clutter and distractions can be a great starting point. If tidying your digital space and creating a productive schedule reinvigorates the joy you once had in your career, that’s great!\n\nHowever, sometimes tidying may not be enough to revitalize your love for your work. Even relocating, staying within your career field but in a new city, may not satisfy the itch for something better.\n\nI worked in the journalism industry for six years. I started as a sports contributor with my local paper my senior year in high school. Halfway through college, I received a job offer at a newspaper and decided to finish my degree online.\n\nAfter two years of working professionally, I realized that journalism was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. It didn’t provide the intellectual stimulation I craved. Also, working from 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. did not fit with my dream lifestyle.\n\nSo I began seeking out other opportunities where I could write and make a decent living. That’s when I stumbled upon an advertisement for a law firm seeking a legal writer. After conducting some more research into legal career paths, I registered for the LSAT and applied to law school.\n\nMy law school hosted a welcome orientation dinner. I chatted with people from all walks of life and varying motivations for becoming lawyers. By the end of the evening, I felt as if I had finally found my calling. These were the type of ambitious people I had been longing to be around my whole life. People with drive and purpose. Those who knew what they wanted to achieve and were taking steps to make their goals a reality.\n\nIt’s never too late to change career paths. I started school in the part-time program, continuing to work in journalism to help pay for school. I was among the youngest in that program. My peers were middle-aged single mothers, former auto sales reps, youth pastors, and more.\n\nIf returning to school is out of the question because you lack the time or resources, begin expanding your network. If you want to join a specific profession, seek out people who already work there. Attend workshops or social events and speak with those who have experience in the field. Learn what skills you already possess that can be transferred. Take some online courses or watch free videos to educate yourself on the skills you lack.\n\nDon’t keep waking up to work at a job you dread. Find a career path that sparks joy in your life.\nFriendships\n\nI had a best friend in junior high, we’ll call her Elaine, who I spent most of my time with until high school graduation. I graduated valedictorian and went to college on a full-ride scholarship. She had dropped out a year prior and pursued a GED. Our lives were beginning to take different paths.\n\nWhile I began to expand my horizons through my courses and extracurricular activities, Elaine stayed in the small rural town where she grew up. As I met new people and got exposed to several different mindsets, Elaine failed to broaden her social sphere.\n\nWhen I came home for the summer to stay with my parents after that first year in college, I was a different person. I tried to share my new experiences with Elaine, but all she could talk about was our former high school peers.\n\nOne day while we were out shopping, we saw someone with whom I had graduated. This girl had been a bully to us, but I no longer cared. However, Elaine still had the mentality of a high schooler and began making fun of her outfit and hair. At that moment, I realized that we were drifting apart.\n\nThe next summer, after my second year in college, is when we had our falling out. Elaine and I had gotten into an argument when she issued an ultimatum. Either I had to agree with her, or we were no longer friends. We haven’t spoken to each other since.\n\nI could have reached out at some point over the past few years. When the friendship ended, it was painful. But I recognized that I no longer needed her immaturity and toxicity in my life. I needed friends who would help me become a better person, not someone who reminisced about high school and enjoyed making fun of others.\n\nSince then, I’ve had to cut two other friends out of my life. One of them had become a one-sided friendship where I was putting in all the effort, and she only called when she needed something or wanted me to validate her poor life choices. The other friend I stay in touch with only on Facebook. If I see a meme or an article that I think she would enjoy, I’ll send her a message. But we no longer hang out in person.\n\nThese friendships had begun holding me back. Spending time with these women no longer sparked joy in my life. They had become sources of bittersweet emotions. I was still clinging to the person I thought they were when we first became friends.\n\nI silently thanked these women for the good times and the lessons that I learned, then let the friendship fade away.\nRomantic Relationships\n\nI lived with my ex-boyfriend for nearly eight months. We had been together for almost a year when we moved into a shared apartment in October of 2017. By the following February, I realized that I was unhappy in the relationship.\n\nHe didn’t have a job, and he wasn’t looking for one either. My ex was pursuing his dream of becoming a professional online gamer. I had offered to work and provide for us so that he could pursue his dream. All asked was that he do the cooking and cleaning. He did so occasionally.\n\nAbout 80 percent of his time was dedicated to gaming. He would sleep for maybe four or five hours each day. He did set one day of the week aside to spend time with me and focus on our relationship. But this eventually became a chore to him. I could tell that he was thinking about his online matches while cuddling and watching television with me.\n\nIt took a while, but slowly I came to realize that he was just using me. His parents refused to let him live at home if he didn’t have a job, and I provided an escape for him to do nothing but play online games.\n\nAt first, I denied it. I didn’t want to believe that this person I loved was taking advantage of my kindness and desire to help him achieve his dreams.\n\nThe relationship didn’t end until June — four months after I realized it was no longer working. I was too scared to end it. Too afraid to leave the familiar and be alone. Sad to admit, he was the one who broke it off with me because he’d met someone online.\n\nIt hurt like hell, but I needed that relationship to end. I am forever grateful that my ex left when he did. I learned to set higher standards for what I want and need in a relationship.\n\nA few weeks after the breakup, I met my absolutely incredible fiancé. We share the same goals in life and both have high aspirations for our careers. Our relationship brings me an immense amount of joy.\nConclusion\n\nDon’t stay stuck in a rut. It can be challenging to take that first step toward a career change. It can be painful to end a years-long friendship or a long-term relationship. But it can be so rewarding.\n\nWhen you tidy up your life by leaving a dead-end job or ending toxic relationships, it makes room for positive influences to enter and bring you joy. Being unchained from negativity allows you to pursue your ideal lifestyle.\n\nSpend time reflecting on your life. Evaluate what areas are important to you. Then ask yourself, “Does this spark joy?”",

        "title": "Six Spokes Theory: Strategy For An Optimal Life",
        "description": "Imagine that your life is like a wheel with six spokes. A wheel will keep moving if one of your spokes is broken or missing. But if multiple spokes are not working, your wheel will collapse.\n\nTo live an optimal life, you need to make sure all your spokes are tight. With a functional wheel, you’ll be able to move forward smoothly. In contrast, if your spokes aren’t tight, you might risk a bump in the wheel, which will make it hard to move.\n\nI call this Six Spokes Theory. For most of us, this is the best way to look at life. Here’s what the spokes represent:\n\n    Body: The condition of your body, including your diet, stamina, strength, and recovery.\n    Mind: Your ability to focus, rest, and acquire knowledge.\n    Love: Your relationship with family, friends, kids, and intimate partner.\n    Work: How much inner satisfaction and financial rewards you receive from your career.\n    Money: What you do with the money you have.\n    Play: How well you’re able to entertain yourself.\n\nUnlike other life theories, this is not about becoming successful. Six Spokes Theory is about living an optimal and balanced life. It’s not about becoming the best in the world, and it’s also not about sacrificing certain areas in life so you can be successful in your career.\nHow To Apply Six Spokes Theory To Daily Life\n\nHow can you use this theory to live better? One thing you might notice is that every spoke is equally important for a wheel.\n\nWe can’t say that our work is more important than our body. If we neglect taking care of our body, our work will suffer eventually. In life, everything is connected. If you neglect one area of your life, you will somehow get punished for it in the long-term.\n\nThat’s why I find the wheel analogy so useful. I grew up in The Netherlands, and the bicycle was always my primary mode of transportation. I’ve had a missing spoke several times. I could continue cycling, but it was risky.\n\nIf I didn’t hit a bump in the road, everything was fine. But once, I remember having one broken spoke, and a few others that weren’t tight. I tried to cycle up a sidewalk and as soon as my wheel hit the curb, it dented and nearly collapsed. I couldn’t use my bike anymore.\n\nThe same idea works for the Six Spokes Theory. Let’s say you temporarily neglect your “Body Spoke” and don’t work out. You’ll be fine for a while. But if you keep neglecting your body for a long time, life will serve you the bill in the form of injuries, illnesses, and feeling tired all the time.\nBalance Your Energy, Not Your Time\n\nThe biggest challenge with living an optimal life is how much time you spend on all the areas of life. Conventional thinking says, “I need allocate my time to everything equally.” That type of thinking causes frustration and inner conflict because it’s impossible.\n\nBy its nature, work eats up the majority of our time. If you look at Six Spokes Theory from that perspective, you would say that some spokes are more important than others. But that’s not true.\n\nRemember, all spokes are equally important. It’s foolish to say that work is more important than love. Everything matters. One way to think about balance is that you want to spend the same amount of energy on every area.\n\nImagine you have 6 blocks of energy. You need to spend that energy during the 18 hours you’re awake. But let’s say you need to work for 8 hours.\n\nYou’ll need to be careful with how you spend your energy during those 8 hours. You can’t go full throttle. Work slowly. It’s just like heart-rate running. Have you ever tried that? The idea is that you can go on for much longer if you train at 70% — 80% of your max heart rate.\n\nMaybe you’ll be able to run for two hours at 70%, but only 25 minutes at 90%. It’s all about energy expenditure. If you go faster, you don’t go far. This is one of the biggest contradictions in life. That’s why we struggle with it so much.\n\nMost of us consume energy that’s meant for another area in life. When you do that, it’s like riding a bike that’s missing a spoke. It might work, but it’s risky. So when you use more energy for work, you might have no energy to spend on strengthening your body.\n\nRemember: We only get frustrated when we try to balance our time. It’s impossible. We can’t give the same amount of time to our body, mind, love, work, money, and play. But we can’t afford to ignore these areas either. That’s why we need focus on how much energy we spend on every area.\nExamples In Every Day Life\n\nThe Six Spokes Theory is about smart energy consumption. This theory will not work if you expend energy on negativity and useless activities. One must be thoughtful all the time. Here are some examples.\nLove\n\nWhen I spend time with people I love, I give them my full attention, support, and treat them with kindness. That has several consequences:\n\n    I don’t focus on quantity since you can’t love everyone\n    Being kind doesn’t mean you swallow your words, you need to be honest as well\n    I can’t be preoccupied with work or other things in life\n    I need to be in a good place myself, otherwise I can’t support others\n\nMoney\n\nEvery day, I consciously decide to treat my money with respect. I don’t squander it. I don’t dream of having more of it. I see it as a tool. When I used to see someone driving a fancy car, I thought, “Wow, I want to make more money so I can buy a car like that.”\n\nBut then I realized everything comes at a price. And I’m not willing to sacrifice my other spokes so I can be “successful.” I’d rather have an optimal life.\nPlay\n\nI like having fun in different ways. I enjoy watching comedy. I like reading books. I recently picked up archery. I play video games. Some days I just do it for 30 minutes, but it’s not about the time, it’s about the effect this has on me.\n\nI also don’t need anyone to entertain me. There are thousands of things I can do on my own that give me joy. But can I do it forever? No, I have five other spokes in my wheel.\nAre All Your Spokes Tight?\n\nSix Spokes Theory shows that we can’t neglect important areas of life if we want to live optimally. This requires making tough choices. While we can’t neglect any area of life, we also can’t do everything we want at the same time.\n\nWe have constraints on our energy. This has a big impact on our life and work. This theory might not help you to become the best in the world. But 99% of people don’t even have that desire. We have the desire to live a good life — a full life with six functioning spokes.",

        "title": "What Does “Spirituality” Actually Mean?",
        "description": "In response to a recent article of mine on the shadow in the spiritual world, someone responded with the simple question: “What does spirituality mean? Does it mean you believe in spirits?”\nWell, for some that might be true, but somehow that doesn’t seem like a satisfactory answer to this person’s question. More importantly, I’m not sure he was looking for an answer so much as venting some frustration.\nThere’s something about the word spirituality that causes many people to cringe when they hear it. I have encountered a lot of resistance when I tell people that I write books about spirituality. The word raises people’s hackles right away. I get it. It used to do the same to me. But why so much resistance to a single word?\nI can only speculate, but I believe for some people, the word is a euphemism for religion, and when they hear it, they interpret it as a code word for someone wanting to share their beliefs about God or to tell others what they must do to avoid a fall from grace.\nFor others, I believe, the word is something of a placeholder. People use it to suggest that they are not driven solely by material needs or are not self-centred. When someone says, “I’m spiritual but not religious,” it conveys the sense that they are connected something larger than themselves, but without any penchant from proselytism. How often, though, have you asked someone to explain what spirituality means to them, only to discover that they can’t articulate an answer?\nIn my opinion, the reason the word invites suspicion is that it lacks a real definition.\nTo dispel this resistance, I want to suggest a new way to think about spirituality for those who feel they are on a spiritual path but don’t know how to explain it, and for those who find themselves bristling at the first mention of the word.\nA New Definition of Spirituality\nThe simplest definition of spirituality is that it is a view of the world that embraces the infinite possibilities for how life can express itself. Each of us has a place in expressing those infinite possibilities; each of us is a unique facet of the jewel of humanity. Spirituality recognizes this and asks us to see each person as an extension of life’s impulse to express itself in new and unanticipated ways.\nFundamentally, then, spirituality asks us to see each other as the same and as entirely different — to see our differences as emanating from the same, shared impulse of life to flourish in new ways.\nTo accomplish this vision, we have to embrace contradiction.\nThis is why spirituality is not a religion, which, in its most rigid form, lays down a series of tenets to establish conformity. Instead, spirituality is about relating to life in a way that embraces the paradoxes and contradictions inherent in the human condition. It asks you to hold competing viewpoints about the nature of reality at the same time, without trying to resolve their inherent contradiction.\nThe Path Embraces Contradiction, Not Conformity\nTake, for example, our relationship to time. To reflect on life from a spiritual perspective means that we have to grapple with death. We have to accept that we all age and that our physical bodies will perish. In short, our time on this planet is limited.\nAt the same time (no pun intended), spirituality reminds us that the only moment of time that we experience is the present moment. How many of us have heard that nugget of spiritual wisdom that peace and happiness are found when we stay in the present moment? We know that when we are preoccupied with the past, we can feel regret, and when we are fearful of the future, we experience anxiety. But we can never return to the past or jump to the future: Our reflections of the past and fantasies about the future are our mental projections taking place in the present moment.\nSpirituality asks us to relate to life as though time were finite and as if time did not exist, to acknowledge that life is one present moment after another.\nWe cannot escape the passage of time, and yet we are only ever in the present moment.\nAnother paradox is our relationship with each other. We all conceive of ourselves as if we were entirely separate from each other. We inhabit separate bodies, with separate minds, each of us a discrete, unique human being.\nAt the same time, none of us could exist separately. We were brought into this world through another human being, our mother, and our lives have depended fundamentally on our connections to each other. We are never really separate at all, just occupying time and space in different ways, each of us living together, sometimes in unison, sometimes in conflict.\nSpirituality asks us to hold each of these positions as equally valid and precious: We are each unique beings, with unique lives, desiring to express the truth of who we are, however, we might define that truth for ourselves, and at the same time, we are never separate, never disconnected, even when we appear to be in isolation. We only exist in and through each other — working collectively to feed and nourish our physical bodies and by forming families, friendships, communities, and societies.\nFinally, we are all different, with different identities, preferences, languages, histories, hopes, and dreams. Yet we are all the same. We all share the same core issues and desires of wanting to belong and feel loved, to believe that we are worthy, and to feel that we can be our true selves. We occupy different bodies, with unique faces and identities, but we all share the desire to become the fullest expression of who we believe ourselves to be. We all want to know our purpose and feel that we matter.\nThe fundamental truth of spirituality is that each of us has a gift to express: Our life is meant to express that gift. Our life is that gift. The word spiritual captures that ineffable sense that, at the core, we are each a gift to the rest of humanity, thanks to our many differences in appearance or ways of expressing ourselves.\nSpirituality encourages us to embrace our many differences as the expression of our common humanity.\nEach of Us Is a Gift to the Other\nSpirituality, then, is not a dogmatic set of practices to follow nor an empty placeholder suggesting a vague connection to something outside of oneself. It’s the opposite.\nSpirituality is instead the art of examining and letting go of the mental formulations and beliefs we use to try to simplify and organize our human experience. We try to make life less messy by reducing everything to repeatable paradigms and rigid rules, but it becomes less messy the less we try to control it.\nFor example, human beings are constantly evaluating and judging one another, placing each other on an internalized scale of value. Spirituality asks us to suspend that exercise of judgment and embrace our human diversity, to see each other as equally valuable and worthy of all that life has to offer. You don’t have to like everyone equally; you just have to accept that your evaluation of someone doesn’t actually measure their worthiness as a human being.\nIf a conventional or religious approach to life is to reduce complexity by moving towards conformity, the spiritual path asks us to embrace a set of paradoxes and to live at their intersection.\nIn the simplest of terms, spirituality asks us to regard each other with curiosity and wonder for what this person is meant to express in the world and to ask, Am I seeing this person as a gift?\nAsking yourself that question means that you too have stepped on the spiritual path.",

        "title": "Master Your Mind",
        "description": "There is a single point at which the fields of psychology, neuroscience, Eastern spirituality, and martial arts converge. In neuroscience, it is called “conditioned reflex.” In psychology, it is “unconscious competence.” In meditative traditions (especially Zen Buddhism), it is called “no-mindedness.” In martial arts, the exact same concept is often referred to as “mind like water.” Each approach describes a different aspect of the same phenomenon: acting without conscious thought. While scientists are primarily concerned with the mechanics of how such a process works, practitioners focus more on the mental and physical training that facilitates it.\nNeuroscience research has demonstrated that the portion of our brain that controls movement (the motor cortex) begins to activate up to seven seconds before we consciously decide to move. While this opens the door to some intriguing questions about free will, the clear takeaway is that thinking slows us down. If you’ve ever shot a firearm, you know that you don’t consciously decide to blink when the gun goes off; in fact, the challenge is not blinking! Anyone who has ever done full-speed sparring has also experienced this lag time: if you think about what you’re going to do in response to an attack, your defense will always be too late. This is why in every fighting system — as well as in most sports — one of the goals of training is to be able to act from reflex, rather than cognition.\nThe problem, of course, is that unless you are very highly trained, your reflexes are usually wrong. This is why a novice fighter — regardless of how little conscious thought he might be using — will almost never be able to overcome a more skilled opponent. It’s also why, when we speak or respond “thoughtlessly,” we are prone to say things that are incorrect, hurtful, or just plain dumb. So, the question becomes, how do we develop the skill necessary — in both martial arts and life — to respond correctly, without conscious thought? The answer, according to psychology, is quality practice.\nIn the 1970s, a psychologist named Noel Burch developed a wonderfully elegant theory that has come to be called called “The Four Stages Of Competence” (also known as “training the elephant”). According to this model, the learning process progresses from Unconscious Ignorance (not even realizing that a technique exists) to Conscious Ignorance (realizing that you don’t know how to do a technique) to Conscious Competence (knowing how to do the technique while thinking about it) to Unconscious Competence (doing the technique correctly, without needing to think about it).\nAt the Unconscious Incompetence stage, the learner’s “Intuition” (reflexive action) is incorrect. Picture somebody who has never even seen a football trying to throw one; it would be ugly. At the Conscious Incompetence level, the aspiring quarterback would watch good players throw the ball, and try to mimic them. With some decent coaching, he would reach the level of Conscious Competence, at which point he would be able to throw a decent spiral, but would need to think about how to stand, where to grip the ball, and how to move his arm. With Unconscious Competence comes “Right Intuition,” meaning that the skill has become a reflex. At this level, our QB would be able to throw the ball properly, without even thinking about it. The same progression applies to every other skill, from language learning to boxing. This is why, even when caught off guard, a skilled fighter will respond to an attack with a crisp, precise movement, while a beginner will flinch and usually make an unhelpful, spastic gesture.\nWith a physical skill like throwing a football, quality practice involves performing numerous repetitions with attentive focus. As neuroscientists say, “Neurons that fire together, wire together.” Doing something over and over forges the connections in the brain that make a skill more and more natural and intuitive. This is why studies have found that there’s really no substitute for practice: just understanding something is not enough to be able to do it well. (Interestingly, research into “Observational Motor Learning” has suggested that, around the level of Conscious Competence, you actually CAN get somewhat better at something by watching other people do it).\nOf course, you need to be sure that you are doing the technique correctly, otherwise you will “learn it wrong.” A fairly well-known koan (Zen anecdote) tells us of a master who, during a conversation with a student, picks up a brick and starts vigorously polishing it. When his student asks what he is doing, the master replies, “I am making a mirror.” The point of the story is that no amount of effort in the wrong direction will yield satisfactory results. This is why, for example, trying to learn self-defense moves from YouTube videos can be a bad idea: without an instructor to correct mistakes you don’t know you’re making, you are unlikely to learn the technique properly.\nAssuming that you are practicing properly, climbing the Competence ladder will eventually bring you to the level of acting reflexively and correctly, without conscious thought. At this level, you could theoretically be thinking about your grocery list while throwing a football perfectly. However, to understand why this would be inadvisable, we can turn again to the intersection of science and spirituality. According to Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a psychologist who has pioneered the study of “Flow,” the human nervous system is capable of processing about 110 bits of information per second. Estimates by other researchers have contradicted that number, but the point is that our “bandwidth” is not only finite, but quite limited. This is why, as Csikszentmihalyi points out, we can’t pay attention to more than, at the very most, two conversations at one time. It’s also why elite athletes are highly skilled at “changing the breadth of visual attention” — meaning that they don’t think about their grocery lists while competing, but focus very acutely on what’s important, completely blocking out everything else.\nWhile “visual attention,” by definition refers to the external environment, the same process occurs internally. While interviewing people who function at the highest levels of art, science and athletics, Csikszentmihalyi found that they all described, “Lack of awareness of physical needs … A loss of feelings of self-consciousness.” Essentially, their brains dedicated 100% of their bandwidth to the task at hand, not only disregarding external stimuli, but also shutting down all internal thought processes not devoted to the object of their attention.\nThis brings us right back to the Zen concept of “Mushin No Shin” (“mind without mind” or “no-mindedness”), which is exactly what legendary martial artist Bruce Lee was describing when he spoke of “mind like water.” The goal of Wu-Shin (Chinese) or Mushin (Japanese) is for your conscious mind to remain clear, while your unconscious mind responds without hesitation or confusion to whatever you are experiencing. This, to Bruce Lee, felt like water flowing immediately into the form of its environment. More recently, productivity expert David Allen — a karate black belt himself — described “mind like water” as, “A relaxed state of control … Not an empty mind, though. It’s rather one that is operating at a more productive and creative level.”\nAll of these diverse thinkers explain, each in their own way, that acting without conscious thought does not mean functioning in a way that is thoughtless, it means functioning in a way that is frictionless. The mind should not be blank, it should be free. In other words, by releasing your mind of the burden of tracking things that aren’t helpful to what you’re doing, you make bandwidth available to fully process what you’re experiencing. In response to that, your brain can trigger the skills you have mastered through quality practice, allowing you to respond much more quickly and effectively than if you were actually thinking about what you were doing.\nSo, how do you cultivate Mushin? The short answer is: meditation, particularly “mindfulness” meditation. In mindfulness meditation, you practice paying attention to the experience of existence: what you’re seeing, hearing, touching and feeling at any given moment. By becoming aware of your own mind, and observing what it’s doing, you cultivate a sense of separation between your “self” and your thoughts, essentially becoming an observer in your own brain. From that observer’s standpoint, it is easier to shift your focus to whatever you want to pay attention to, rather than to be lost in the endless stream of thoughts that your brain naturally generates. You don’t try to force those thoughts away, or shut them off, you simply don’t pay attention to them. Like the air-conditioner noise that you stop noticing after it’s been on for a few seconds, the thoughts will simply fade out of your consciousness, leaving your brain free to function at maximum efficiency.\nTherefore, paradoxically — and perhaps to give the Zen masters the last laugh — the only way to master your mind is to let it go.",
        "summary": "Anyone who has ever done full-speed sparring has also experienced this lag time: if you think about what you’re going to do in response to an attack, your defense will always be too late. This is why in every fighting system — as well as in most sports — one of the goals of training is to be able to act from reflex, rather than cognition. This is why, for example, trying to learn self-defense moves from YouTube videos can be a bad idea: without an instructor to correct mistakes you don’t know you’re making, you are unlikely to learn the technique properly. In response to that, your brain can trigger the skills you have mastered through quality practice, allowing you to respond much more quickly and effectively than if you were actually thinking about what you were doing. (Interestingly, research into “Observational Motor Learning” has suggested that, around the level of Conscious Competence, you actually CAN get somewhat better at something by watching other people do it).",

        "title": "A Brutally Honest Review of My 10-Day Silent Vipassana Meditation Retreat",
        "description": "No talking. No phones or technology. No yoga pants. No working out. No music. No reading. No writing. No killing (even spiders!). No stealing. No masturbating. No sex. No lying. No drugs or alcohol. No moving during “sittings of strong determination.”\nThe morning gong rings at 4 a.m. sharp to rouse everyone for the opening 4:30–6:30 a.m. meditation session. The first two of 10 1/2 total hours of meditation scheduled every single day. For 10 days straight.\nI am officially in Meditation Prison.\nHow did I end up here?\nIn a questionable moment of sanity, I decided to book a 10-day silent Vipassana meditation retreat for my birthday. I had no idea what I was in for. Without bothering to do much research beforehand, I figured it’d be nice to disconnect and take a break from technology and social media, relax, and do some yoga and meditation. On a good week, I average about 20 minutes of meditation every few days, so this seemed like a solid way to try and practice it more regularly.\nWhen I looked for payment options on the mysterious website Dhamma.org — complete with a spinning wagon wheel graphic that looked like it was downloaded directly from a GeoCities website in 1998— there was none to be found. What was this madness? What kind of place gives you a bed, three meals a day, and daily meditation instruction for nearly two weeks without requiring a significant chunk of change in return? Was I being lured into an international organ harvesting organization cleverly using the guise of a retreat to find deep inner peace as their cover? Was this some sort of Satanic cult? Do Satanists even meditate?\nI had questions.\nDigging deeper, I discovered that all of the meditation courses offered via the site are 100 percent donation-based. They won’t accept any money up front, but you can offer a donation after successful completion of one of their programs.\nIt seemed too good to be true. What was the catch?\nI was about to find out.\nI was accepted for a 10-day course at the Northwest Vipassana Center located in Onalaska, Washington. On my scheduled day of arrival I road-tripped down from Seattle, grabbed my suitcase (complete with clothes, toiletries, pillow, a sheet for a twin-sized bed, and blankets) — and nervously stepped into the simple, single-story building. It kind of felt like I was starting my freshman year of college all over again.\nImmediately upon entering the registration area, I was given paperwork to fill out and a cloth bag into which I was to relinquish my cell phone. The last text that I received was from my father:\n“Mom and I suspect this is a cult. If you feel something is out of line just leave right away.”\nThanks for calming my nerves, Dad.\nThe cloth bag was numbered, and taken away while I was assured it’d be returned on the last day. I sat down to read over the paperwork, preparing to sign away my life:\n While agreeing to all the terms and conditions, I noticed that the men who arrived were sent to residential quarters on the far side of the campus and also had a separate dining area. Division of men and women was required at all times.\nAfter my paperwork was squared away, I was assigned to room 10, spot B. No room key. Just go.\nI gathered my things and found my room. My inner introvert was secretly relieved. No forced small talk? Phew.\nLittle did I know that in less than 48 hours, this feeling would completely change and I would have stolen an entire Halloween pumpkin bucket of full-size candy bars from a small child just to hear another human being’s voice again.\nWe were welcomed by our teachers: a woman named Tina in her 70s who sat in front atop a stool and a guy with a brown beard who looked to be in his late 30s or early 40s resting cross-legged on a pillow.\nAs everyone settled down, I was suddenly shocked by the blasting of an elderly Indian gentleman’s voice over the meditation hall speakers. Though he was extremely passionate and seemingly well-intentioned in his delivery, he also sounded — very unfortunately — like a groaning goat either giving birth, or dying, maybe both. If you’d like to experience it for yourself, go ahead and give this a listen.\nAfter the unexpected chanting faded away, we were instructed by the same voice to focus on our breath. Feel the breath moving in and out of your nose. Feel the sensation caused by your breath in that small triangular area between your nostrils and upper lip. Focus all of your attention here, in this small spot.\nFor an hour, we breathed and meditated together. I finished feeling strong. This was going to be totally doable.\nAt 9 p.m., we were dismissed back to our rooms to shower and rest. My bedtime is normally much later (i.e. I’m writing this at 2:06 a.m.) but upon reviewing the posted daily schedule and seeing I was going to be woken up at 4 a.m. each morning, I tried my best to knock out. It didn’t work, so Day 0 passed with barely any sleep.\nDay 1: Attempting to Herd Cats in My Brain. The morning gong rang at 4 a.m. sharp, as scheduled. I groggily tumbled out of bed and somehow made it to my meditation mat. Swaying from side to side from lack of sleep, I survived the first two hours in a semi-conscious state.\nBreakfast followed from 6:30–8 a.m. We were offered an assortment of bread for toasting (raisin, whole grain, 7-grain, and gluten-free rice bread), a giant vat of oatmeal, some strange boiled fruit in syrup to pour over the oatmeal (raisins, plums, and dates?), a Costco-sized bucket of plain yogurt, granola, and two big silver bowls overflowing with bananas, apples, and oranges. Unsurprisingly, the tea and coffee station proved to be very popular. Everyone was very polite, waiting patiently in line while being very careful not to make direct eye contact.\nI slathered two pieces of slightly burnt raisin bread toast with real butter (not the dairy-free option or anything from the tubs of tahini, peanut butter, or jelly), polished off a banana, and sipped some ginger tea with almond milk.\nAfter eating, everyone politely lined up again to scrape leftovers into a compost bucket, place their used forks and spoons into a silverware bin, and wash and stack their dishes.\nFrom 8–9 a.m., we were to gather for the next group meditation in the hall. After that, there was another 9–11 a.m. meditation marathon before lunch, followed by a 1–2:30 p.m. meditation, a 2:30–3:30 p.m. meditation, and another 3:30–5 p.m. meditation with five-minute breaks in between each scheduled sitting before a 5–6 p.m. tea break, 6–7 p.m. group meditation, 7–8:15 p.m. seated lecture, and finally the 8:15–9 p.m. evening meditation.\nAt some point during these millions of hours of meditation, my butt, back, and basically every part of my body began to hurt, and my mind started to freak out.\nWhy am I here? What am I doing? This was a terrible idea. One hour, fine. Two hours, OK. Three hours, are you kidding me? Five, six, seven, eight and a half more hours after that? Oh god. What if my legs fall asleep? What if they fall off? Can that happen if my circulation gets cut off for too long? Am I going to be able to walk again? Is my mind going to spontaneously combust and kill me?\nI attempted to distract myself from the growing pain in and around my ass by thinking about something else. Anything else. My mind ran with it.  Distraction. Distraction. Distraction. Distraction. Distraction.\nWere any of these things actually happening in the moment?\nNo.\nThe only thing that was real was the fact that I was sitting in a meditation hall on some farmland in the middle of nowhere, Washington.\nThe only thing that was real was my breath, and the momentary sensations flickering on and off across my body.\nThe only thing that was real was that nothing was permanent. Everything was changing, all the time. But yet I fought it. I didn’t like the soreness or the pain. I wanted it all to end.\nAttempting to put a stop my obsessive thoughts about the past, I started fantasizing about the future. What if I stood up and screamed? A piercing sound to slice through the silence? What if I ran around kicking over people’s meditation benches and shaking them in their shawls? What if I stood up, solemnly announced that I quit, and turned to walk defiantly out the door, never to return again?\nMy fantasy faded, and I returned to my breath. Still there. Still steady. Still real.\nDinner consisted of a cup of tea and a piece of fruit.\nAt some point, the hours ended. I crawled into bed at 9:00 p.m., my stomach growling and my mind awake, alive, and alert as ever.\nWant to think some more? What should we think about now? How about now? Now?\nIt was going to be a long night.\nDay 2: Planning My Escape. GONG. GONG. GONG.\n4 a.m. 4:12 a.m. 4:22 a.m.\nIn case you didn’t get up to the banging of the big gong, a volunteer walks around 20 minutes later with a smaller gong, whacking it outside each individual room.\nGONG. GONG. GONG.\n4:30 a.m. Fuck.\nAs I’m putting my clothes on, I can hear my roommate snoring. I feel a mixture of envy, disgust, and annoyance. I want what she has.\nMy resolution to go to every single meditation instantly dissolves. I curl back up in bed and pass out, sleeping through the 4:30–6:30am sitting.\nMy dreams punish me accordingly, maybe out of unconscious guilt. I dream that a man murders a girl. His mother, who happens to be an attorney, refuses to defend him in court. He throws a knife into his mother’s neck and she dies. His best friend is horrified, but — not wanting to upset him — requests a massage using the blood. Suddenly the killer looks directly at me, smiling. I am his girlfriend, and my obedience is expected.\nI jerk awake, sweating through my thin sheet. What. The. Actual. Fuck. I haven’t had a dream that disturbing in a long time. I’m a therapist. I’m too disoriented to do a proper dream analysis on myself. It’s 6:33 a.m. Breakfast time.\nMy thoughts shift from sociopathic serial killers to the type of topping I would like on my toast today. I’m inspired to get creative at the condiment tray.\nWould tumeric and peanut butter toast taste good? Cinnamon or cayenne sprinkled on a banana?\nMy brain is screaming for stimulation. It wants to “like” something and “dislike” something else. It needs to read the news, scan a Facebook feed or watch a movie. It is thinking, thinking, thinking, and obsessively judging everyone and everything. It is judging itself, hating itself, annoyed at itself, and reeling from inner pangs of shame, frustration, and resentment.\nWhere’s this inner peace that everyone talks about? Liberation from suffering? Total enlightenment?\nThe hours pass. My brain switches modes, moving from blasting random songs to replaying entire episodes of Black Mirror. (That “White Christmas” episode was so messed up.)\nThe day passes. My mind swirls, coming up with new business ideas and chapters for a book. I have vivid fantasies about my escape. Minutes and hours pass as I detail where I will go, what I will do, and what I will say as I leave. Escape. Escape. Escape. After lunch, I will escape.\nLunch is a tasty offering of vegetable curry over brown rice, a salad of lettuce topped with shredded carrots, beets, and a sesame-colored “sunshine dressing,” plus a couple scoops of cottage cheese.\nI eat. I fantasize about escaping. I don’t escape.\n1–2:30 p.m., meditate. 2:30–3:30 p.m., meditate. 3:30–5 p.m., meditate. 6–7 p.m., meditate.\nAt 7 p.m., everyone gathers in the meditation hall for the evening discourse. We are about to sit and watch a video over an hour long so I happily busy myself by building a comfortable reclining seat out of bolsters and blocks. Kind of like this, but without the eye mask and with my eyes (mostly) open. After a few minutes of relaxing in my reclined work of art, a volunteer comes by and whisper-scolds me to sit up straight. Damn it.\nI reluctantly deconstruct my makeshift bolster bed and hunch over my mat. It begins.\nThe late S.N. Goenka, the revered teacher of Vipassana meditation, appears in grainy footage dated back to 1991. He is a chubby, cheerful-looking man with a shiny forehead and a crisp white shirt. He looks like a kindly Indian uncle who likes to sing loudly, usually slightly off-key, and gives you sweets while you gather around to listen to his stories.\nExcept now, there are no sweets. Instead, he speaks of the root cause of all suffering: Craving and aversion.\nIf we like something, that liking can turn into craving, which turns into clinging. If we cling to something that we want or like desperately, and then we don’t get it or we lose it, we can become despondent, angry, and miserable.\nIf we dislike something or someone, that dislike can intensify into anger and hatred. When it comes to physical pain, focusing on it, becoming angry with it, and trying to force it to change or go away will only cause it to worsen and strengthen in its power and scope.\nAt one point, S.N. Goenka says,\n“The thing that hurts you the most in life is your own untamed mind. The thing that can help you the most in life is a disciplined mind. When the wild mind is untamed, it can be very harmful. If we learn to tame our minds, then it can help us by reducing our suffering and misery.”\nBut how do you escape the misery? By understanding that pain, sadness, and suffering are a natural part of life. You also have to understand that these are temporary and ever-changing, just as joy, happiness, and pleasure are. If you stop fighting things you don’t like and stop desperately trying to hold onto things you do like, life can become more peaceful. Everything is temporary, so just notice each feeling. Observe it, without any sort of craving or aversion. Everything will ultimately shift, change, or go away, and that’s OK, because something new will take its place.\nThis is a practice that offers a way out of suffering. Living not in the past nor in the future, but right now, in the present.\nFor the first time, a tiny ray of light glints through a crack in the darkness. I think that maybe there’s something to this after all.\nIt sucks, but I vow to keep sticking it out.\nDays 3, 4 and 5: The Suck, a Poem. It was a rainy, soggy, shitty mess during days three through five. The weather decided to match my mood.\nWe are taught to switch from focusing on the triangle between our nostrils and our upper lip to scanning our entire body for both subtle and intense sensations, from the top of our head to the bottom of our toes. We are to do so with an equanimous mind, merely observing, not reacting, craving, hating, or judging.\nEverything hurts. I continue to struggle in an upright seated position for over 10 1/2 freaking hours each day. Distraction. Past. Distraction. Future. Distraction. Past. Distraction. Future. And despite the request for Noble Silence, a couple people continuously burp and yawn loudly. I judge them, annoyed that they would disturb the silence so rudely when they could exert a little effort to contain themselves. I’m noting that this checks the boxes of both a dislike and an aversion. I am supposed to generate love for Mr. Loud Sigh-Yawn and compassion for Burpy McBurpeeson who I feel would be immediately cast as the lead in an all-burped Phantom of the Opera.\nI have a lot of work to do. Day 6: Tina, I Have Questions\nStudents are allowed a five-minute Q&A session with a teacher from noon to 1 p.m. This is the only time we are allowed to speak.\nI sign up. I have questions.\nI arrive at my assigned time and am ushered inside. Tina awaits my entry in the otherwise empty meditation hall. I notice she is wearing black New Balance sneakers beneath her long skirt.\nMe: Isn’t pain an important indicator? Our body’s way of communicating danger to us? How do we determine when and if to react to pain? For example, if someone is burning us with a hot iron, we can’t just observe it and calmly think, “interesting,” before moving on to a different part of the body, right?\nTina: We are learning to observe pain without reacting to it. Explore and observe the pain. If you are in danger or if it is pure torture, take care of yourself. Remove yourself from the danger. Stand up and walk around for a moment. Otherwise, simply notice it. Where is the pain? Where is its epicenter? Where does it begin and where does it end? Don’t stay in it if it’s intolerable. Also understand that it’s not permanent, and this practice and experience is an opportunity to face more and more of your pain in a new way, by observing it instead of reacting to it. If you keep observing and allowing it to be, while staying neutral, it will eventually pass because everything is temporary, even the worst pain. This is a way out of suffering.\nMe: Isn’t liking and disliking things part of nature? A dog likes treats and getting its belly rubbed. It dislikes being hit, and will react by biting whomever hit him. Aren’t we wired to seek pleasure and avoid pain? How can we understand what is healthy and good liking as well as disliking, versus excessive craving and unhealthy aversion?\nTina: There are different degrees of liking and disliking something. It’s unhealthy when you inflict suffering on yourself due to your preferences. For example, let’s say you’re really excited to eat chocolate cake for dessert, but when it’s time for dessert, there’s no chocolate cake left. It’s OK and healthy to be disappointed, but then say, “oh well,” and move on. Don’t let the lack of chocolate cake disturb your peace. If you get angry and miserable because things didn’t turn out the way you wanted and hoped, this is what the Vipassana practice helps to free you from. Why make yourself more miserable about something that is temporary? Don’t let your disliking of a person, thing, or situation rob you of your happiness and peace of mind.\nMe: Speaking of chocolate cake, if my stomach growls when I’m hungry, shouldn’t I eat? Right now, I’m not sleeping well because I’m going to bed hungry. I’m not used to skipping dinner. Then I wake up tired and grumpy because I’m attached to sleep. I have a strong liking and craving for sleep, and I function a heckuva lot better when I have enough of it. I think I could meditate and focus better if I got more sleep. Wouldn’t it be more helpful if I could have more than tea and an apple for dinner so I can wake up more refreshed and alert to do better at this meditation practice?\nTina: It’s true that human beings need food, water, and shelter. However, unless you are actually starving, it can be a helpful practice to observe and accept your hunger during the day or at night. If you lay down and can’t sleep but you are resting your body and mind, you will wake up feeling rested. Be aware of your strong attachment to sleep. If you get angry and make yourself more miserable because you are not sleeping, you’re feeding your craving for sleep and it’s robbing you of your peace by making you mad that you don’t have it. Keep noticing and observing the sensations with an equanimous mind.\nMe: I’m playing mind games with myself to get through the meditation sittings. For example, one game I play with myself is, “If I just complete three more full body scans, then I’ll reward and treat myself by allowing my mind to escape into a fantasy about the past or the future for a bit.” Is this OK?\nTina: Your mind games are also a fantasy and future-oriented. We are working on being in the present, not trying to escape into the future. Keep doing the work and take it one body scan at a time, because that is all that’s happening right now.\nMy time with Tina is up. It’s time to be quiet and get back to the backbreaking work of more (and more and more) meditation.\nDay 7: I Break Noble Silence (Five Times). By this day, I’ve broken my Noble Silence a grand total of five times:\n“Oooh, snake.” (When I saw a tiny snake slither out from the brush, as if exclaiming what it was out loud would somehow prevent it from attacking me)\n“Yum!” (When I ate a deliciously sweet blackberry that I picked from a wild blackberry vine)\n“Ouch!” (When the vine’s thorns pricked me)\n“Oooh, bunny.” (When I came across a cute wild bunny eating a fern)\n“Desss-paaa-cito.” (Uttered inadvertently while I was showering — damn you for being so catchy, Justin Bieber)\nI’m working on judging myself less. We are told “never to be disappointed, angry, or upset” with ourselves for making mistakes. We are encouraged to “gently and smilingly come back to the practice of scanning your body from the top of your head to the bottom of your toes with a calm and equanimous mind.”\nEverything still sucks.\nDuring the discourse this night, S.N. Goenka talks about “five friends that will help you on your path to liberation from suffering:” Faith and devotion, wise effort, wise attention and awareness, concentration, and wisdom. He tells amusing stories to illustrate each point. I do my best to listen through a heavy haze of pain.\nDay 8: Impermanence, a Poem. The pain has started to wax and wane with each body scan. It’s excruciating, sharp, and intense during one sweep, and completely gone the next. Then it’s back again before fading to a dull throb. Holy crap. This Vipassana meditation thing works. Pain really is only temporary and ever-changing.\nI’m not out of the woods yet, but the glint of light has turned into a stronger glimmer. I try not to become attached to any outcome.\nBe here now. That’s all there is.\nDay 9: Today Was a Good(ish) Day. After the 4:30–6:30 a.m. and 8–9 a.m. meditations, we are allowed to come out of Noble Silence and enter a period of Noble Speech.\nS.N. Goenka calls this a “soothing balm to help heal our wounds after doing surgery on our minds.” The transition is supposed to help us ease back into the real world.\nIt’s strange being able to look at everyone and finally talk to them. I take a moment to gather myself in my room to enjoy a few more precious moments of peace and quiet before going out into the chatter.\nAcross the board, the most common question I’m hearing asked is, “How was your experience?”. Here’s a sampling of the answers I hear:\nOMG MY BODY TOTALLY DISSOLVED! I WAS ONE WITH THE UNIVERSE!\nEverything hurt for awhile and when I accepted and observed it, the pain went away. I started noticing pleasant sensations, like my entire body had been dipped in good vibrations.\nI sweated a ton. Tina told me that this was anger and negative old patterns leaving my body. Apparently I have a lot of rage.\nI’ve done this course four times now. The first time I felt nothing, the second I felt everything, the third time I felt mixed things, and this time I dissolved my body halfway.\nA lot of emotions came up for me. I focused on taming my mind.\nMy husband passed away last year. I knew if I didn’t find something to help me calm down my mind, I’d go crazy with misery and sadness. This helped me.\nI completely dissolved and my whole body became a mass of vibrating particles.\nThere was a surprising amount of talk of “body dissolving.”\nMy body didn’t “dissolve,” and that’s OK. If I’d heard about that experience earlier, I probably would’ve developed a craving to have that sensation, tried to chase it, and felt upset if it didn’t happen.\nIt makes sense that we weren’t allowed to talk with each other until the last day. Comparison is the thief of all joy.\nThe day continued with talks about the importance of serving and giving back, not just with money, but as a volunteer for future courses. S.N. Goenka encouraged us to be happy and for all beings to have peace. We ended with a new meditation of love and compassion, sending out good vibes and caring intentions, pardoning those who we may have been intentionally or unintentionally hurt by, asking for pardon from those who we may have intentionally or unintentionally hurt, and wishing for the liberation, peace, and happiness of all beings. Very lovey-dovey stuff.\nI was tired and not sure how strong my vibes of love and compassion were, but I did my best.\nAnd that was it. A little anticlimactic, but it was what it was — for me, at least.\nWas it a cult? No.\nWas it a magical cure-all for life’s problems? No.\nWas it the ultimate way and the only path to enlightenment? No.\nWell then, what was it?\nThree Main Takeaways and Final Thoughts\nI found Vipassana meditation to be a tool. Like any tool, if you use it properly, it can be helpful. By scanning your body, paying attention to both slight and significant sensations, and observing instead of reacting to them, you can gain more mastery over your mind and a greater ability to focus, concentrate, and exist in the moment instead of obsessing about the past or fantasizing about the future. Regardless of your religion or belief system, living in the present is a pretty cool thing.\nIt was a powerful experience to objectively observe my mind and all of its crazy-making. By being stuck with it for hours, I noticed where my brain goes to escape from discomfort and how I avoid both emotional and physical pain. I learned more about how I cope by examining what I crave and try to avoid. I also learned that I can be in the suck and it, too, shall pass. It’s OK to feel sadness, anger, worry, pain, and suffering, just like it’s OK to experience pleasure, joy, and excitement, and that all of these feelings will ebb and flow. Nothing is permanent, and that’s life.\nI was able to reconnect with my body. By noticing and experiencing soft and gentle sensations on and in my body, from the feeling of my clothing to the air on my face, I recognized and appreciated subtle feelings again in addition to stronger ones. All are real, all are valid, and I don’t need to go chasing intense highs to feel something. I’m always feeling something, I just have to take the time and make the effort to notice it. As someone who has been disconnected from my body at times, this was a seemingly small achievement, but a very big one to me..",

Keep doing the work and take it one body scan at a time, because that is all that’s happening right now.

I knew if I didn’t find something to help me calm down my mind, I’d go crazy with misery and sadness. Everything hurt for awhile and when I accepted and observed it, the pain went away. I think I could meditate and focus better if I got more sleep. All are real, all are valid, and I don’t need to go chasing intense highs to feel something. If you feel something is out of line just leave right away.”\nThanks for calming my nerves, Dad. The thing that can help you the most in life is a disciplined mind. I attempted to distract myself from the growing pain in and around my ass by thinking about something else. When it comes to physical pain, focusing on it, becoming angry with it, and trying to force it to change or go away will only cause it to worsen and strengthen in its power and scope. As someone who has been disconnected from my body at times, this was a seemingly small achievement, but a very big one to me.. If I’d heard about that experience earlier, I probably would’ve developed a craving to have that sensation, tried to chase it, and felt upset if it didn’t happen. However, unless you are actually starving, it can be a helpful practice to observe and accept your hunger during the day or at night. We are encouraged to “gently and smilingly come back to the practice of scanning your body from the top of your head to the bottom of your toes with a calm and equanimous mind.”\nEverything still sucks. Pain really is only temporary and ever-changing. By scanning your body, paying attention to both slight and significant sensations, and observing instead of reacting to them, you can gain more mastery over your mind and a greater ability to focus, concentrate, and exist in the moment instead of obsessing about the past or fantasizing about the future. Without bothering to do much research beforehand, I figured it’d be nice to disconnect and take a break from technology and social media, relax, and do some yoga and meditation. I take a moment to gather myself in my room to enjoy a few more precious moments of peace and quiet before going out into the chatter. It was going to be a long night. It’s time to be quiet and get back to the backbreaking work of more (and more and more) meditation. Regardless of your religion or belief system, living in the present is a pretty cool thing.",

        "title": "4 Carl Jung Theories Explained: Persona, Shadow, Anima/Animus, The Self",
        "description": "The Persona\nIn every public arena we present an exaggerated version of ourselves which we hope will make an impression. The character we display in our occupation is not the same as at home. When alone we have no one to impress, but in public we wear a mask, a persona, so that we might impose a desirable image of ourselves onto others. Every profession has subtle agreements about the manners which are acceptable, and those which are not; and it is expected that the individual will adapt to these requirements without anyone having to openly explain them. A doctor, for instance, is expected to behave as a doctor should, with a patience and sympathy that would be difficult for an ordinary person to achieve; any propensity for impatience or hostility would not be acceptable, and for good reason.\nIt is then the distinct purpose of the persona to subdue all of the primitive urges, impulses, and emotions that are not considered socially acceptable, and that, if we were to act upon them, would make us look fools. Anyone with any sense at all sees through the façade; but we each participate in pretending that all this is real, so that society might carry on as normal. The difficulty with the persona arises only when one becomes so closely identified with his role that he loses all sense of self. At this point the damage is surely done: he will be entirely unaware of any distinction between himself and the world in which he lives. The result of an inflated persona, Jung warned, is a ‘shallow, brittle, conformist kind of personality which is ‘all persona’, with its excessive concern for ‘what people think.’ Such a person will sacrifice himself for the wishes of others without limit — not because he is a saint, but because he does not have the courage to refuse and endure conflict.\nThe Shadow\nIf nothing else, the persona is obedience to expectations; it is the mask one wears to convince himself, and others, that he is not an altogether bad person. But one cannot go beyond the persona until he has incorporated into his character those darker character traits which belong to what Jung called the ‘shadow self’. The shadow is everything that we have denied in ourselves and cast into oblivion, or rather everything that the ego has refused to associate with itself, but that we can notice in other people — such things might include our sexuality, spontaneity, aggression, instincts, cowardice, carelessness, passion, enthusiasm, love of material possessions. It embraces all those sins, dark thoughts, and moods for which we felt guilt and shame.\nThe shadow is necessarily emotional in nature, for it must oppose the rigidness of the ego; it holds its own autonomy, separate from the conscious mind. Therefore, in being instinctive and irrational, the shadow is prone to psychological projection, whereby we attribute to others all our evil and inferior qualities that we do not want to admit are in ourselves. ‘A man who is unconscious of himself’, Jung writes, ‘acts in a blind, instinctive way and is in addition fooled by all the illusions that arise when he sees everything that he is not conscious of in himself coming to meet him from outside as projections upon his neighbour.’ (The Philosophical Tree, page 335.) When we perceive a moral deficiency in others we can be sure there is a similar inferiority within ourselves. ‘If you feel’, Von Franz writes, ‘an overwhelming rage coming up in you when a friend reproaches you about a fault, you can be fairly sure that at this point you will find a part of your shadow, of which you are unconscious.’ If we observe our resentment towards ourselves and others, and if we consider the moral aspects of our behaviour, then we have the opportunity to bring the shadow into consciousness, and achieve a renewed sense of strength and independence. Anima/Animus\nJung believed that nested inside the shadow are the qualities of our opposite gender. The anima is the archetype that expresses the fact that men have a minority of feminine qualities; and the animus expresses the masculine qualities within women. In every man there is a woman, and in every woman a man; or rather, there is the image of the ideal man/woman, which is, as a rule, formed in part by the experience of our mother/father, and by the influence of culture and heritage. One might argue that the ideas of feminine and masculine are based on arbitrary stereotypes. But Jung presented the concepts of the anima and animus as the ancient archetypes of Eros and Logos. Eros (the female) is associated with receptivity, creativity, relationships, and wholeness.. Logos (the male) is identified with power, thought, and action. (In Ancient Greek Eros means ‘love’, or ‘life energy’; whereas Logos is the term for a principle of order and knowledge.)\nThe anima then is a personification of all feminine tendencies, positive or negative, in a man’s psyche. A positive expression of the anima might include sensitivity and empathy, capacity for loving relationships, a feeling for nature. But if the anima is rejected — that is, if a man represses those characteristics which might be considered classically feminine — the anima becomes deformed: feelings and emotions are replaced by moodiness, sentimentality, hysteria; fidelity becomes possessiveness; aesthetics become sensuality; tenderness becomes effeminacy; imagination becomes mere fantasizing. The animus, on the other hand, is a personification of masculine tendencies in a woman’s psyche, such as strength of conviction, assertiveness, courage, strength, vitality, and a desire for achievement. But if the woman disregards her masculine edge then she will become possessed by the animus: assertiveness will become aggression and ruthlessness; and analytical thought will become argumentativeness.\nAs with the shadow, the archetypes of the anima/animus have their own autonomy, and are independent from our conscious mind. Thus the anima/animus can be projected in the world so that they appear to be some qualities of a particular man/woman. In the presence of the anima, or at least a good imitation of anima, a man feels a peculiar familiarity with her, as if he has known this woman for all time; in some cases, the energy between the two is intoxicating, to the degree that one might say he has fallen in ‘love at first sight’. In truth, he has fallen in love with a deception, with the image that he has projected onto another woman. It is only when the mirage of the projection disperses will he realise himself as a fool. Once the projection is withdrawn the anima can be recognised as a force within oneself. After having integrated the anima, men seemingly reconnect with a divine power in the inner world — which might express itself as a creative ability, or a sensitivity for the natural world— which must have always been within them; but which had to be shown to them by the presence of the feminine, by the guiding hand of a woman.\nThe Self\nAfter one has overcome the persona, and integrated his shadow and the aspects of the anima/animus archetypes into one’s character, one then is given access, Jung believed, to enter into the deepest and highest reaches of the psyche, the archetype of wholeness– which Jung named the ‘Self’, the most significant of all the archetypes. ‘The Self embraces’, Jung writes, ‘ego-consciousness, shadow, anima, and collective unconscious in indeterminable extension.’ (Mysterium Coniunctionis, page 108.) The self then is the sum of everything we are now, and everything we once were, as well as everything we could potentially become; it is the symbol of the ‘God within us’, that which we are as a totality.\nThe archetype of the self is the origin of our impulse towards self-realisation; it is the single point from which our character and our personality matures as we grow older — just as a seed holds the whole potential future of a flower. It is the Self that brings forth what Jung called ‘the process of individuation’, which begins from the potential of childhood to an expansive journey of self-discovery, whereby one consciously and gradually integrates the unconscious aspects — the parts of ourselves that we have refused to confront — of one’s personality into the whole. Jung believed that it is the end purpose of human life to experience this coming together of the whole, to fully integrate and make conscious everything about ourselves that was hidden in the shadow. This end is the fullest expression of one’s character, and allows one to hold firm their individuality against the collective mass unconscious.",

        "title": "5 Eckhart Tolle Gems To Help Center You Today",
        "description": "Eckhart Tolle, author of the acclaimed bestseller “The Power of Now,” is my favorite spiritual teacher. Why? Because his teachings contain the powerful combination of being simple but profound, the hallmark of all timeless wisdom. Incorporating the following five nuggets of his into your life will go a long way toward centering yourself in the often crazy, hectic world we live in.\n1. “Accept this moment as it is.”\nNotice that Eckhart isn’t directing you to ‘Be in the moment,’ or ‘Live in the moment.’ Why? Because most people have trouble saying to themselves, ‘Okay, let’s be present. Just be here, now.” This direct path to the present can feel jarring and usually doesn’t work very well, or at least not for long.\nFor most, the easier way to access the present moment is indirectly, by addressing the obstacles preventing you from being there at any given time. And that main obstacle is usually plain old resistance. We don’t even know that we’re doing it, but in MOST of the moments of our lives we’re resisting something happening in the present. You’re driving home, you’re on time and you’re stopped at a red light. What are you doing? Resisting that moment because you’re waiting at a light. “Turn green, damn it! I need to get to some better moments!” Or waiting in line at the store. There are thousands of examples of this. What they all have in common is what you are saying to yourself: “I can’t wait for this moment to be over so I can get to some better ones in the future.”\nSo what Eckhart’s quote provides is a back door entry into the present moment. He’s saying that whatever is going on in the present moment, just accept it as it is. I would add just one more word to emphasize this concept — EXACTLY. Accept this moment exactly as it is. Doesn’t mean you have to love every single moment. You just need to accept it. It’s there. Don’t fight with it. Don’t resist it. I’m telling you, if you start doing this, and by this I mean catching yourself resisting something that’s happening in the moment and then accepting it, you will feel the knots of anxiety and tension inside you just melt away.\n2. “Instead of asking, ‘What do I want from life?’ a more powerful question is, ‘What does life want from me?’”\nDon’t look at this one as being a reprise of John F. Kennedy’s clarion call to the nation in his 1961 inaugural address where he said, “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” Eckhart’s words here are not about serving the world instead of yourself. They’re much deeper than that. ‘What do I want from life?” is a superficial question that springs from the egoic “I” in all of us. “I want money.” “I want to be important and powerful.” And even, “I want to change the world.” People who approach the question this way can, and certainly have, accomplished what their egoic “I” set out to achieve. But that usually comes with a cost: a feeling of emptiness and lack of fulfillment all along the way.\n“What does life want from me?” on the other hand, goes to a deeper part of yourself. In fact, you can replace the word ‘life’ in that question with ‘the universe,’ ‘God,’ ‘Providence,’ ‘nature,’ or whomever you think is running the cosmic show. Eckhart is asking us to go deep inside and listen to that mysterious voice within that communicates our destiny to us, if we would only listen. The people who do this, the people who “follow their bliss” as the great Joseph Campbell put it, live dynamic, energetic and fulfilling lives.\n3. “You are never more yourself than when you are still.”\nThis one is huge and sets the table for the supreme spiritual question: Who am I? Most people believe that they are their thoughts. They believe that all the craziness going on in their minds is who they are. “If that woman flirts with my boyfriend one more time I’m going to rip her head off. Oh my god, I’m such a jealous nut case!” No, you’re not! Your mind and your thoughts are not who you are.\nSo who are you? Just as Eckhart states so eloquently, you are the stillness inside you. What the hell does that mean? It’s the you that exists when your mind is still and you’re not spewing out meaningless thoughts that race around your head like racecars around Daytona Speedway. It’s your conscious self. The real you. The brilliant you. The central thrust of most spiritual traditions is to get you to identify with that and not the crazy, mind-controlled you.\nBut my mind is crazy most of the time, you’re saying. So how do I get it to become ‘still’ and therefore access my real self? The best way is to develop a meditation practice. The aim of meditation is to focus your attention on something happening in the present moment, like your breathing. Then when your mind wanders, and it will, you just bring attention back to your breathing. Repeating this simple practice regularly will help slow your mind down and aid in your ability to be the conscious observer (who you are) of your thoughts (not who you are).\nHow do you get started with meditation? It’s not that big a deal. When I started meditating six years ago I created my own program. I made it simple, doable and designed it so that a regular person, like me, would be successful in developing a long-term practice. The program is eight-weeks and starts off with meditating for two minutes a day then building gradually from there. I strongly urge you to try it. And the good news is it’s free. You can access it at davidgerken.net.\n4. “Surrender is the simple but profound wisdom of yielding to rather than opposing the flow of life.”\nHere’s another massively important concept that Eckhart has winnowed down to one beautiful sentence. We all put so much effort into trying to control the events of our lives that we constantly resist what life has put in front of us rather than flow with it. It’s the control freak nature of humans (especially Americans!). The problem is that it’s futile, frustrating and a major energy killer. When you surrender to, and flow with, what life/God/the universe puts in front of you, good things tend to happen and you feel lighter, calmer and more in alignment with your nature.\nWhat’s the best possible thing you could do to get a handle on this surrender thing? Take Michael Singer’s course Living From a Place of Surrender. It’s eight eloquent, moving hours of Singer exploring this subject and offering a simple technique for surrendering/letting go. I took it and it was a game-changer for me. You can find it at Soundstrue.com.\n5. “Awareness is the greatest agent for change.”\nI’ve seen several videos where Eckhart is asked a question from the audience about some difficulty they’re having with one of his teachings. Something like: “I get what you’re saying about being present, but I just can’t help it, my mind always wanders. What can I do?” And he answers the same way every time, “So you’re aware that you’re mind is wandering?” Audience member: “Yes.” Then he invariably says, “Great. You’ve already accomplished the most important thing. You’re aware of what you’re doing.” Bottom line, awareness really is the whole ball game on the spiritual path.\nWhy? Because awareness is what enables you to step back and become the conscious observer (which again is who you are) of your thoughts and mind activity, etc. For example: “I’ve been dwelling way too long on that snide comment my girlfriend threw at me this morning. Time to snap out of it and move on with my day.” And when you become aware of some wacky or troubling thought, you’re doing something absolutely essential to spiritual growth: you’re creating two entities, the subject (the aware observer, i.e. the real you) and the object (the wacky thought).\nFor most humans there is almost always only one entity — the crazy thoughts, and because of this you get lost in them and consumed by them. How could you not? That’s all there is. When you build up your awareness “muscle,” over time you’ll get better at not letting your out of control mind dictate your life. And that, my friends, is arguably the most important and healthy feat any human can achieve. Once again, meditation is the best practice for strengthening your awareness muscle, for obvious reasons.",

        "title": "An Invaluable Lesson I Learned That Transformed My Meditation Practice",
        "description": "Anybody who’s meditated for any length of time knows this: some sessions are good and some are pulling-teeth awful. The good ones connect us to our home base, make us feel centered and are marked by a physical feeling of inner calmness. The bad ones are full of uncontrollable, racing thoughts and anxious feelings that make us feel worse than if we hadn’t meditated at all. Many meditators, especially those in the early stages of their practice, give it up if these “bad” sessions continue for too long. The fundamental mistake these people make lies in what they believe to be the purpose of meditation. Hint: That purpose is not, as most people believe, to feel divinely serene and peaceful inside, an invaluable lesson I learned a few years ago from Western meditation pioneer Joseph Goldstein.\nA little background. Along with Jon Kabat-Zinn, Jack Kornfield and Sharon Salzberg, Goldstein helped bring meditation to America in the 1970s. I had been meditating regularly for five years when I took Kabat-Zinn’s Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course in 2017. One of our course readings was a short chapter in Goldstein’s book Insight Meditation: The Practice of Freedom. The chapter eloquently describes what the purpose of meditation is and isn’t.\nUp to that point in my practice I’d experienced hugely frustrating periods where I wondered why the hell I was even meditating. Luckily, I persisted.\nRadiant meditation sessions turn to twisted steel\nThe lesson Goldstein taught me came in the story he tells in the chapter about a particular experience he had while practicing in India intermittently in the late 60s and early 70s. During one several month sojourn to India Goldstein’s meditations were off-the-charts sublime. As he described them, “My whole body dissolved into radiant vibrations of light. Every time I sat down, as soon as I closed my eyes, this energy field of light pervaded my whole body. It was wonderful, it felt terrific.”\nAfter those mind-blowingly great months he returned to America for a while. When he returned to India not long after, he expected to resume those other-worldly, radiant sessions. Guess what? It didn’t happen. Not even close. In fact, his sessions were the worst he’d ever experienced. As he put it, “Not only was there no longer a body of light, but my body felt like a painful mass of twisted steel…There was so much pressure and tension, so many unpleasant sensations.” Twisted steel? Yikes.\nThen it dawned on him: meditation is not about feeling great or achieving ecstatic states of being. It’s about being completely open to whatever is happening in the present, good or bad, radiant vibrations of light or twisted steel in your gut. Doesn’t matter. The point is to just observe, nonjudgmentally, any sensations you might be feeling or experiencing.\nMeditation isn’t about achieving ecstatic states\nGoldstein’s epiphany hit me like a ton of bricks…in a good way. Ever since reading this, whenever I’m feeling anxious, unsettled or uptight in a session, I just step back and literally say inside my head, “Okay, I’m feeling anxious.” And I observe it. And sit with it. And most important, I don’t resist it. Or engage with it. Or fight with it. Why? Because that anxiousness is the reality of that present moment. As Eckhart Tolle so succinctly puts it, “Don’t resist what is.”\nAny of you out there who are just getting into meditation or are considering starting a practice, please take note: This really is the whole ballgame of meditation. It’s all about being present with whatever is happening in any moment.\nMindfulness: also about accepting good AND bad moments\nThe same is true for meditation’s brother — mindfulness. I define mindfulness as simply being present in your daily life. If you’re washing your hands, place your attention on washing your hands, as the great Vietnamese monk Thich Nhat Hanh says. If you’re hitting a golf shot, focus on that, not letting your mind wander to the presentation you have to give a client the next morning.\nAs with meditation, so it is with mindfulness in your daily life: be present and accept whatever’s happening in any given moment. So much of the tension and anxiety we experience comes from simply resisting what’s happening in moment after moment after moment. And most of the time we’re not even conscious that we’re resisting those moments! In fact, the next time you find yourself anxious or uptight, just stop and ask yourself: “What am I resisting right now? In this moment?” Once you identify it, just relax and let that resistance go; once you do, the tension inside you will disappear.\nThe good news is that the more you practice this “just accept whatever’s happening in the present moment, good OR bad” thing, the better you’ll get at it. That goes for both your meditation and mindfulness practices. And the better you get at it, you’ll find that the bad/stressful/anxious periods start to diminish. And when these periods do come, they pass much more quickly than when you used to wrangle, engage and fight with them.\nPrinceton rain vs. Hawaii rain\nHere’s an analogy that captures this last concept. When I went to Princeton, there were many days when I’d wake up, look outside and see it was raining. And it bummed me out. Why? Because I knew that that rain was going to stay there all day long and that I’d have to walk to tennis practice in our indoor facility jumping over puddles and avoiding general misery. So Princeton rain is what happens when you resist and fight with uncomfortable moments. They linger.\nIn Hawaii, rainstorms move in quickly, drop their water, then leave. In, then out. And everybody gets back to doing what they were doing. No harm done. Hawaii rain is what happens when you just observe the stress and anxiousness you’re feeling in any moment — whether while meditating or just going about your day. It comes, you observe it and then it goes. So resist your tough periods and you’ll get Princeton rain. Nonjudgmentally observe them and you’ll get Hawaii rain.\nTry my meditation program\nFinally, if you’re thinking about starting a meditation practice, I’d advise you to give my program a try. I made it simple, doable and designed it so that a regular person, like me, would be successful in developing a long-term practice. The program, which I’ve written as an ebook called Five Steps to a Regular Meditation Practice, is eight-weeks and starts off with meditating for two minutes a day then building gradually from there. The good news is it’s free. You can access it at davidgerken.net.",

        "title": "Spirituality + Programming",
        "description": "The words “spirituality” and “programming” aren’t usually used in the same sentence. But I grew up in a household that promoted meditation and thoughtful reflection. My dad had a small meditation room that we used, and my brothers and I spent time meditating from a young age.\nOne of my brothers is a musician now, and the other works at a tech startup in the digital mental health field. We’re all different, but I see all three of us approaching the world with a high level of intellectual and spiritual curiosity.\nI honestly believe that growing up in a spiritual household where meditation and reflection were the norm has made me a more intuitive programmer.\nHere’s why:\nIt Fostered Intuition And Curiosity\nThe curiosity that fuels my projects is partly influenced by growing up in a spiritual home. My parents created an environment where spiritual and intellectual curiosity was encouraged.\nI’ve noticed that when my brothers and I do things, whether it’s a creative project or a tech project, we have a desire to observe other individuals and their interactions. We’re curious. We want to consume that knowledge and learn from it.\nAnd that curiosity also helped teach me to rely on my intuition. There are plenty of things (frequencies, wavelengths) that are beyond human perception, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t there.\nThink of the range of sound frequencies that a dog can hear, but we can’t. Yet, if you’re paying attention — and you realize that all the dogs in your neighborhood are going crazy — you’re extending your perception. You intuitively know that something is happening outside of your normal range of perception.\nProgramming requires you to work with complicated systems that interact in complex ways. Having a high degree of intuition and perceiving those interactions is critical to a programmer’s ability to design complex chains of cause and reaction.\nGrowing up in a home where intuition and curiosity were nurtured absolutely helped me develop those necessary skills.\nI Learned The Rules — And How To Break Them\nI’ve always been interested in the rules and complexities of different subjects. Growing up in a spiritual household heightened my perceptions of different systems and their interconnected relationships.\nBefore I got into tech and programming, I was very into English literature, critical theory, symbolic systems, writing, and linguistics. That’s actually what I studied in college. But, even before that, when I was a sophomore in high school, an English teacher gave me some advice that stuck. She told me,\n“You need to learn the rules before you can break them.”\nShe was talking about grammar in that instance, but I think it’s applicable to coding — and life in general — as well. You have to have an awareness of the rules and the way things work before you can start breaking those rules.\nIn grammar, once you’ve learned all the rules by heart, it’s fun — no, creative, rather — to break them. To deviate. To create new forms. I became really obsessed with grammar for a little while, and it was fun to write creatively. It was fun to break the rules.\nOnce you know the rules, your intuition guides decisions about breaking them.\nThe same is true for programmers. It’s one thing to write a logical, linear argument — it’s another to be able to write poetry with code.\nI Learned When To Deviate\nWhen you know the rules and deviate from them, it’s called creativity. When you don’t know the rules, your deviation from them is just an unintentional act. It could be good, it could be bad — but it’s not creative.\nWhen I broke the rules at home, my parents didn’t ground me. They didn’t stop me from seeing my friends. But they did make me write an essay about what I had done. That kind of alternative approach was critical for developing self-awareness and learning contemplation. It helped me understand what the rules were and why they existed. It helped me understand both sides of an issue.\nI wouldn’t say I’m a rule follower, but I’m aware of them. I like learning the rules. I also know that you don’t have to adhere to them at all times.\nI started having “aha!” moments as I wrote those essays. I began developing a deep respect for understanding both sides. I began examining rules and their uses in a ways that allowed me to deviate from them more mindfully.\nAnd I believe that all comes through in my programming. All those years of being taught to examine the rules, to follow my intuition, and to carefully decide when to break those rules — it’s made me a deviant, intuitive programmer.",
        "summary": "She told me,\n“You need to learn the rules before you can break them.”\nShe was talking about grammar in that instance, but I think it’s applicable to coding — and life in general — as well. I Learned The Rules — And How To Break Them\nI’ve always been interested in the rules and complexities of different subjects. In grammar, once you’ve learned all the rules by heart, it’s fun — no, creative, rather — to break them. You have to have an awareness of the rules and the way things work before you can start breaking those rules. I’ve noticed that when my brothers and I do things, whether it’s a creative project or a tech project, we have a desire to observe other individuals and their interactions.",

        "description": "One of my greatest talents has always been coming up with an excuse for putting off something I didn’t want to do.\nSkipped the gym? Eh, I’ll just make up for it tomorrow.\nHit the snooze button? Well, I needed the rest.\nBrushed off a task on my to-do list? It wasn’t that important.\nProcrastination is always an inner battle. But losing it has greater consequences than a missed workout or a blown deadline every now and then.\nSix years ago, I tried to pursue my dream of becoming an entrepreneur: I did some freelance writing, built websites, and took on some content marketing and design projects. But, despite all the time I put in, I wasn’t seeing the results I wanted. Why? Because I couldn’t get myself to do the uncomfortable work — the difficult, tedious, and unsatisfying tasks that come with actually building a business. I kept looking for relief from those tasks, often scrolling through the news or going out (yet again) for a coffee break.\nThat was, and to a degree still is, the story of my life. Right now, I’m writing a book. Writing is hard. I keep fighting the urge to put off the work. But I’m moving along and getting it done. The only difference between my life six years ago and my life today is that I now have a system. Here’s what I mean. To be truly productive, you can’t rely on hacks or apps or new technologies. Trust me. I’ve tried. You need to develop your own sustainable system, a set of routines and practices that serves as the foundation of your work. My system looks like this:\nI exercise my mental toughness every day. I used to neglect my brain. I didn’t trust my instincts and would spend my time overthinking. So I started reading about Stoicism, Pragmatism and mindfulness, which helped me to control my thoughts and improve my mental toughness.\nI exercise my body every day. When I don’t exercise, I lack focus, confidence, and energy. So I now do daily workouts. Overcoming procrastination starts before you fight the inner battle. Soldiers don’t go to war untrained, right?\nI have a set of daily habits. I journal, read, set daily priorities, and don’t consume useless information. I also make sure I interact with my friends and family every day. Human contact is important. All of these things keep me grounded and help me actually enjoy my days.\nI carry a list of small, but important, tasks that I must complete. I often think about all the logistical things that come with writing a book besides the actual writing. I do everything I can to get out of adding new words and new pages to my book draft. So I break the big task of writing into more manageable pieces, giving myself small daily writing assignments to complete. It’s about doing the big things first.\nAs you may have noticed, not all of these things are related to the work directly. That’s okay. My system gets me in the right headspace to get the work done. It makes me a more disciplined person, so when I sit down to write, I can power through all my distracting thoughts and actually write.\nYou will always want to procrastinate. But if you have a system, you can be productive in spite of that. Work on creating one today — not tomorrow.",

        "title": "There’s no such thing as motivation",
        "description": "I’m not highly motivated.\nI don’t have amazing willpower or self-control.\nI don’t get up at 6 am to read, meditate, drink a green smoothie, and run 10K.\nThat’s because I don’t believe in motivation.\nInstead, I’ve built systems and habits that remove my internal drive from the equation. So, whether or not I feel “motivated,” I can still be productive.\nI realize that systems and habits are not a glamorous topic, but honestly, they work.\nThey’ve fuelled every step of my entrepreneurial journey over the last 12 years — from the early days, when JotForm was just a simple idea, to growing a team of over 110 employees who serve 3.7 million users.\nHabits and systems have made it all possible.\nIf you create reliable systems and continue to improve these systems (instead of your willpower), you don’t even have to think about motivation.\nLet’s break it down a little.\nWhat the heck is motivation, anyway?\nIn the simplest terms, motivation is your desire to do something. It’s a sense of willingness that exists on a spectrum — from zero interest to a burning desire to take action.\nWhen your desire is strong, motivation feels effortless.\nBut when you’re struggling, just about anything sounds better than starting the assignment, making a tough phone call, or hitting the gym. Procrastination takes over — until the agony becomes overwhelming.\nAs Steven Pressfield writes in The War of Art,\n“At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it.”\nI love this quote because I suspect we’ve all felt this painful moment. That’s when it’s harder to stay on the couch than to get up, put on your sneakers, and go outside.\nThe two types of motivation\nIn his 2011 book, Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us, author Daniel Pink splits motivation into two different types: extrinsic and intrinsic.\nExtrinsic motivation is external. It’s money or praise or trying not to look clumsy on the tennis court.\nIntrinsic motivation comes from within. It’s the desire to act, even when the only reward is the activity itself (or completing a task). Intrinsic motivation implies that you’re acting for authentic, honorable reasons. For example, you start a business to help people or solve a problem — not because you’re dazzled by visions of fame and fortune.\nMotivation gets in the way, though, when we rely too heavily on it.\nNo matter how much you love your business, there are probably moments when you don’t want to take action.\nMaybe it feels scary or impossible, or the task at hand is downright boring.\nThat’s when systems can do the heavy lifting. Here are a few strategies that have helped me to build sustainable systems so I don’t have to rely on motivation.\n1. Choose your focus areas — and ignore the rest\nFocus and motivation might seem like two different topics, but they are closely intertwined.\nTake me as an example. This year, I have 3 work priorities:\nHiring really great people\nCreating quality content\nEquipping our users to work more productively\nThese themes inform everything I do. If a project or an opportunity doesn’t fit into one of these three buckets, I say no. Distractions slip away and I can make real progress.\nFor example, I spend the first two hours of every workday writing out my thoughts. It might be a problem I’m trying to solve or a new idea. I don’t book meetings during this period and I definitely don’t answer emails.\nBut, if I arrive at work feeling less than inspired, I give myself permission to do something else — as long as it fits within my three focus areas. Instead of writing and problem-solving, I can read articles or books on these topics, meet with a product team, or watch a lecture.\nAll that thinking and exploring soon makes me feel more engaged. Once I’m engaged, I come up with better ideas. And good ideas inspire me to take action.\nThis process isn’t accidental. It’s a simple feedback loop I use to get moving on days when my brain feels stuck in neutral.\n2. Remember that motivation is optional\nIn a 2016 article for The Cut, author Melissa Dahl shares,\n“the only motivational advice anyone has ever needed: You don’t have to feel like getting something done in order to actually get it done.“\nGo back and read that again, if you want. I know I did. Let it sink in.\nIt’s surprisingly brilliant. Your feelings don’t have to match your actions — especially when you truly want to move forward.\nYou could feel tired, but still put on your goggles and go for a swim. You could feel like you’d rather staple yourself to the chair than build another PowerPoint deck — and you still get the presentation done.\nDahl also quotes Oliver Burkeman, author of The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can’t Stand Positive Thinking, who writes:\n“Who says you need to wait until you ‘feel like’ doing something in order to start doing it?\nThe problem, from this perspective, isn’t that you don’t feel motivated; it’s that you imagine you need to feel motivated.”\nOnce again, this is where routines can outsmart feelings. Sure, you might feel like watching cat videos, but every morning, you sit down at your computer and open a blank document.\nYou write for two hours (or whatever your routine entails) and you don’t bother taking your emotional temperature.\nProgress ensues. Then you repeat, repeat, repeat.\n3. Delegate whenever possible\nImage for post\nThe other day, I had a great idea during my morning workout. It was one of these eyebrow-raising lightbulb moments.\nUnfortunately, it had nothing to do with my three focus areas I mentioned above. So, I made a note in my phone and asked our COO to follow my mental thread.\nI was tempted to chase it myself, but I knew I had to stay focused.\nI realize that delegation isn’t always possible, especially when you’re just starting out or money is tight. JotForm is a bootstrapped company.\nWe’ve never taken a dime in outside funding, so I know what it’s like to watch every dollar.\nBut when it’s possible, delegation can pay off, big time. Offload an activity if:\nYou can regain precious time, energy or focus and apply it to something that will truly move the needle for you. That kind of work is priceless. Stretch yourself a little and measure the results. You can always test delegation in baby steps.\nSomeone else can do it better. In my case, there’s almost always someone on our team who has more knowledge or niche expertise than I do. They’ll create a stronger result in less time — and again, I don’t get distracted from my goals.\nThe importance of enjoying the ride\nWe’ve talked a lot about everyday motivation. But how do you sustain your drive for the long run?\nIt’s an important question. The answer will look a little different for everyone, but ultimately, we’re all motivated by joy and meaning.\nGuardian columnist (and The Antidote author) Oliver Burkeman first led me to Buddhist teacher Susan Piver. Tired of forcing herself to be “good” and master the daily to-do list, Piver decided instead to focus on the pleasure of her work:\n“Once I remembered that my motivation is rooted in genuine curiosity and my tasks are in complete alignment with who I am and want to be, my office suddenly seemed like a playground rather than a labor camp.”\nShe asked herself what would be fun to do and then focused on what she loved about each activity.\nIn the end, her day looked the same as it did when she was “disciplined” — but the experience was nearly effortless:\n“Yes, discipline is critical, just like all the teachers say.\nAnd there is definitely stuff that needs doing that is just never going to be fun, like paying bills and cleaning the cat box.\nBut I suggest that instead of being disciplined about hating on yourself to get things done, try being disciplined about remaining close to what brings you joy.”\nTalk about a perspective shift. We all go through tough times, work at jobs we don’t love, and endure genuine unfairness.\nBut if you’re struggling to do something you care deeply about, go easy on yourself.\nTap into why you started your business, or why you’re flexing your creative muscles in the first place. It’s a much happier way to move through your days.\nTo recap: establish your systems and habits. Stay focused on what matters. Delegate and tune out the noise. Your motivation will grow.\nAnd if it doesn’t? You don’t need it anyway.",

        "title": "How to Solve Your “Lack of Motivation” Problem",
        "description": "I know what it feels like to have no motivation. I’m talking zero motivation.\nHere’s a list of some of the laziest things I’ve done:\nI used to watch Law and Order SVU marathons for 8 to 12 hours at a time, never leaving the house.\nI drank and/or smoked weed daily for at least a full year.\nI’ve had a major porn addiction.\nI got a 0.00 GPA one semester in college and wasn’t even smart enough to drop out. I paid for the classes and didn’t go.\nI’ve been there.\nYou feel like you have all the talent in the world to be successful, and you do, but you continue to cling to this identity that you’re not a ‘motivated person’. And each time you do try to clean up your act and fail, it further solidifies that identity.\nIf you have no motivation and want to change that, you have to change your identity. To change your identity, you have to adopt actions that disconfirm your old identity and gradually help you to build a new one. To adopt the right actions, find something that excites you and compels you to work hard.\nFrom someone who’s been on both sides, I’m confident in telling you that going from having no motivation to tons of motivation is more than possible. If you follow the path I’m going to describe, you won’t even feel like the old you existed. You couldn’t fathom that you were ever that lazy at a certain point in your life.\nSo…what do you do? How do you fix your seemingly perpetual laziness problem?\nThe Only Source of Motivation I’ve Found to Ever Work\nIf you find something that excites you, you have a chance to turn up that motivation dial. Finding these opportunities doesn’t guarantee you anything, but they’re your closest chance of a saving grace.\nWhen such an opportunity arises, or you actively search and find one, jump on it and ride it as long as you can.\nYou might try and fail, but those moments will at least remind you of what you’re capable of if you stick with them for at least a little bit.\nI had many motivational waves before I found my ultimate wave of writing.\nI joined some MLM pyramid scheme companies. One positive takeaway from these companies? They teach you personal development. I started reading books, listening to audiotapes, and even though I never made any money with these companies, I kept my nose clean while I was in them because I was inspired to. Ultimately, I quit, but persisting at something for a couple of months put that subconscious signal in my brain that I was capable of more.\nThere were semesters in school where I did very well because I found activities that excited me and stimulated my natural talents, strengths, and curiosity. I joined the student council and had my highest GPA that semester. Then, after losing the election to become Treasurer the next year, I quit.\nWriting was the motivational wave, the thing that was so exciting for me, that it stuck.\nThe lesson here?\nRiding a bunch of motivational waves and falling short counts for something. Even if you end up quitting, sustaining any level of motivation for any moderate length of time reminds you that you are capable. Then, when you find something truly aligned to your talents and strengths, you can ride the wave for a long time — maybe even for the rest of your life.\nSome practical recommendations for this include:\nSay yes to everything: Go to that local event you see on a flier at a coffee shop. Download the free PDF guide from your favourite internet marketer and do what it says for once. Buy that book or course. Take any remotely positive opportunity you can.\nFocus on your talents and strengths: Don’t be afraid to lean into exactly who you are. This isn’t to say you can’t do what you want, but your odds are higher if you do what you’re pre-disposed to doing. Don’t know your talents and strengths? There’s a guide at the end of this post to help you find them.\nRemember what you’ve been excited about: If you are legitimately clinically depressed and have never had moments of excitement or joy, then you need professional help. But for everyone else, odds are, you’ve been excited about something in life. Think about these things and understand you already have some level of motivation in you. How to Go From No Motivation to An Abundance of Motivation\nThe self-help game is simple — find and ride waves of motivation. Sometimes you feel particularly inspired to do something. When you feel this way, seize the opportunity. Honestly, when you don’t feel this way, you won’t do anything about your situation. That’s where motivational content comes in. It’s simply there to provide the spark, but you have to do the thing.\nAnd the good news? You always have hope. You really do.\nI’m not saying that in a pandering way at all. Your current situation could change drastically until you reach a point where your old life seems like an illusion. I share my story so much because there’s no better way to illustrate the power of self-improvement than to tell you what it’s like moving from one side to the other.\nIt’s crazy. I’ve been extremely lazy. Maybe lazier than you. I had everything going for me, systematically ruined my own life one bad decision at a time, found myself in a truly bad spot, and dug myself out of it. I don’t know how deep your personal definition of having “no motivation” is, but mine was pretty damn low.\nI’m picturing myself right now back at the electronics factory I worked at for 12 hours a day making $10/hr — sitting on one of the tables outside in the smoking area, puffing away at menthol, savouring every minute of my break because this was the most mind-numbingly boring job I’ve ever had.\nIn the back of my mind, I always felt things would pop eventually, but at that time my situation looked hopeless. I dropped out and didn’t have a degree. I was still on felony probation. Most all my friends had left the college town I was in. I lived in a dorm room because they allowed you to accrue credit instead of having to pay rent right away.\nThis was my life.\nThe person whom many people look up to now, who probably think I’m perfect, exceptional, or somehow more capable than them is the same person described in the paragraphs above.\nI found my passion and found personal development. Both saved my life. And both can save yours. But you have to fully let them in.\nBe Patient Until it Finally Sticks\nKeep reading the self-help content to get you fired up until it sticks. Watch the cheesy YouTube videos with the rocky theme music. Read all the self-help classics. Keep yourself mentally above water so you can seize an opportunity when it strikes.\nHere’s the thing. What choice do you really have? I understand that self-improvement is often ineffective and that most people never reach their dreams. Still, I don’t see a logically better route than continuing to make attempts at getting it all to work, no matter how many times you mess up.\nAnd you only have to get a few things right a few times to shift the trajectory of your life.\nThe more you focus on personal development, the better able you are to see opportunities. Even if what you’re doing right now doesn’t seem very effective, understand that it’s the path to a better life. Also, understand one important truth about you.\nYou say you have no motivation, but you’re reading an article about how to get more motivated. Look at this definition of motivation from Merriam-Webster:\n“The general desire or willingness of someone to do something.”\nReading a blog post about how to find more motivation fits this definition. You at least have the desire or willingness to read this article. You are doing something.\nIf you truly had no motivation, your lack of motivation wouldn’t bother you because…you’d have no motivation to change.\nSome people, many people, have given up. I met quite a few of those people at that electronics factory. You’re not one of those people. The fact that you’re reading this means you’re not one of those people. Remember that.\nI know who you are. You’re a seeker.\nSeekers always have the best chance to win in life. Even if you haven’t materialized your thoughts into outcomes, you still actively think about how to live a better life. Most people just daydream. You, at least, are active enough to look for an answer.\nTrust me, it’s better than nothing. It’s a start.\nI don’t have a magical guarantee for you. I never make promises that if you follow my secret success recipe everything will work out. I’m certain you have hope, though. I’m certain you have a chance and that you’re much more capable than you probably know.\nAnd I’m certain that this message will get through to a handful of you. That’s why I write. Not for the masses. I can’t save everyone. But I can help a few people save themselves.\nAre you one of these people? Only time will tell.",

        "title": "Human Motivation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution",
        "description": "Modern civilization has undergone three significant socio-economic transformations known as industrial revolutions. The first industrial revolution was built around steam and transformed modern society by redefining transportation and the manufacturing process. Next, the advent of electricity ushered forth a second revolution by providing a highly efficient energy source and modernizing communication, which according to Thomas Edison, worked to “reorganize the life of the world.” Electricity then paved the way for our third (and current) digital revolution, liberating civilization from fossil fuels and putting technology into the hands of over 4 billion people worldwide. The common thread that connects each great revolution is the idea that technology, broadly defined, allowed society to advance by redefining the ways we participate and contribute in an economy as a result of improved quality of life. The impending fourth industrial revolution is no exception, and according Klaus Schwab, it’s barreling toward us at breakneck speed. Are we prepared to take on the roles that this fourth revolution will introduce, and have our motivations and societal constructs evolved to match the challenges and opportunities that it will present?\nEach transformation shifted our economy further from one based on brawns to one built on brains. In the past, social rank depended on the ability to do physical work. Now, in addition to skills like critical thinking and problem solving, other non-cognitive skills such as persistence, self-control, and curiosity play a role in the new stratification of class. In addition, there has been a steady change from innovations as tools that support a human’s work, such as assembly lines and steam engines, to those that take on the lion’s share of work with humans as moderators of machines and quality controllers of novel forms of artificial intelligence.\n“Today, non-cognitive skills such as persistence, self-control, and curiosity play a role in the new stratification of class.”\nUnderstanding how each successive transformation has altered the way we make decisions demonstrates how our current society might evolve to meet the challenges of the next transformation. By delineating the human motivations that drive our interactions in the digital revolution, we catch a glimpse of our potential to change culture and impact the quality of our lives in the fourth industrial revolution. As the interactions between man and machine become more personal, our motivations have moved from extrinsic to intrinsic. Extrinsic motivators such as income, prestige, and praise are being supplanted by intrinsic desires of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Never has this been more evident than in the surprising way we are motivated to participate in the open development of technology in the digital age.\nHuman Motivation: From Me to We\nIn his prominent TED talk, Dan Pink uses motivational theory to explain why we are contributing to the digital age in new and unexpected ways. Pink cites evidence of these intrinsic motivators in the all-volunteer contributions to the most popular web server, Apache, the world’s largest online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, and the free open-source operating system, Linux. Why are people using their “limited discretionary time” to contribute to the open source projects that fuel our current economy? In a word: purpose. The rise of the digital economy has shed light on the intrinsic motivator of purpose, which drives people to share their expertise in their limited free time, free of charge.\nCreative leaders have always understood that engaging humans in purposeful work increases motivation and leads to greater outcomes. Innovative companies and educators harness this understanding by implementing the 20% time method, with which employees and students are encouraged to use a portion of their time to work on projects of their choosing. While still relevant to their work and study, these projects often breathe new life into the workplace, resulting in innovations such as the humble post-it note and Gmail. More importantly, the 20% time method has invigorated future members of our workforce to participate in meaningful work by solving problems in their daily lives.\nImage for post\nCorliss steam engine (via The British Library)\nProblem solving, communication, and collaboration are essential in this model of human motivation that drive the digital economy. Each new innovation is predicated on these non-cognitive skills that are cornerstones for success in the digital economy and will be even more important in the impending revolution. Our economic habits and decisions as individuals and as a society will fundamentally change our culture, which is why it is paramount to ensure that our basic needs are met so we can continue to contribute and participate in the fourth industrial revolution.\nFinding Purpose and Pay in the Fourth Revolution\nThe distinction between physical, biological, and digital worlds may finally be indistinguishable from one another in the next industrial revolution. In this new era, the line between what exists physically and what exists virtually will disappear. The mash-up of biological and digital technologies is no longer a thing of science fiction as evident by the few leaks we’ve seen from startup MagicLeap, a company that recently procured an astonishing $1.4 billion in investments for a revolutionary technology that blends the physical with the digital in a featherweight pair of glasses. When the separation between the actual and the virtual is eliminated, the relationship between humans and technologies will undergo a remarkable shift. Will new business models in the fourth revolution require human work in the same ways they have in the past?\nAssuming our basic needs for food, shelter, belonging, and self-esteem are met, our minds are free to work towards self-actualization and the sense of purpose we innately seek. Motivational research tells us that humans desire a sense of purpose in our work — a desire to contribute to society in meaningful ways beyond our paid work. Current technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) may tap into these desires in new and remarkable ways. There are countless potential applications for these technologies. For example, students can see the why of learning when an augmented reality application shows the human heart pulsing in real time, which might cultivate a revolutionary new generation of surgeons. When AR wearables increase employee productivity by 46%, the conversation rightfully shifts from automation causing job loss to increased efficiency when humans partner with technology.\n“What happens when the human aspect of the human-to-technology collaboration is rendered obsolete; when the technology becomes efficient enough on its own, actively replacing the human in the equation?”\nIn the new hybrid economy where the lines between man and machine are blurred, there will be more room for human-to-human collaboration aided by immersive technological tools. The current trend is mixed reality (MR) with the current debate around the hardware that will be crowned king. Most people working in this space believe these platforms will reshape the nature of education, work, and entertainment once they’re ubiquitous. But in addition to human-to-human collaboration, we’ll also see human-to-technology collaboration, suggesting a paradigm shift where humans support emerging technologies instead of vice versa (read: assembly line). But what happens when the human aspect of the human-to-technology collaboration is rendered obsolete; when the technology becomes efficient enough on its own, actively replacing the human in the equation? Are we prepared to mitigate the cost of potential wide scale unemployment if the future of work shifts from human-powered to machine-powered?\nFresh Perspectives for an Uncertain Future\nSome countries have begun wrestling with big questions of employment in the face of a changing economy. It is true that the nature of employment will continue to shift and that there will always be roles for humans, but it is also true that many of the current jobs may be done by intelligent machines. To get ahead of a transformation that may leave millions jobless, an assurance that people’s basic needs are met seems ever relevant. But how can we ensure that humans maintain a sense of purpose in an economy that has left them behind?\nFirst proposed by Thomas More in his 1516 novel Utopia, universal basic income (UBI) could evade a wide-scale unemployment crisis brought on by the fourth industrial revolution. While there is no long-term research on a such a system, the famous Mincome study (“minimum income”) demonstrated no major difference in working habits for those eligible for these federal funds. What’s more, researchers found a decline in hospital visits and mental health issues possibly as a result of the security provided by such a program.\nThis unusual social experiment set the stage for new perspectives on how UBI might impact the quality of life during the fourth industrial revolution. In preparation for the automation that could cost humans their jobs, economists at the Roosevelt Institute used a macroeconomic model to study the impact of UBI. What they found is that the economy can not only withstand such a system but that “within eight years of enactment, growth returns to the same rate as in the baseline, with output at a permanently higher level.” Others are moving from models to active pilot studies of these systems, acknowledging that evolving technologies may result in fewer jobs for humans.\nWhile we cannot predict the careers of the future, we can see how technology will transform the ways in which we work and play. But regardless of the changes in technology, human drive towards purpose will remain. Our ability to solve problems creatively is a uniquely human behavior; one that will secure us a critical role in the fourth industrial revolution.",
        "summary": "The common thread that connects each great revolution is the idea that technology, broadly defined, allowed society to advance by redefining the ways we participate and contribute in an economy as a result of improved quality of life. “Today, non-cognitive skills such as persistence, self-control, and curiosity play a role in the new stratification of class.”\nUnderstanding how each successive transformation has altered the way we make decisions demonstrates how our current society might evolve to meet the challenges of the next transformation. Will new business models in the fourth revolution require human work in the same ways they have in the past? It is true that the nature of employment will continue to shift and that there will always be roles for humans, but it is also true that many of the current jobs may be done by intelligent machines. For example, students can see the why of learning when an augmented reality application shows the human heart pulsing in real time, which might cultivate a revolutionary new generation of surgeons.",

        "title": "The Simple Secret to Finally Finding True Motivation",
        "description": "Have you ever had this moment happen to you?\nI’m sure you have.\nYou might have it once a month, once a week, maybe daily depending on how aware you are of your own circumstances.\nWhat moment am I talking about?\nThat moment where you think to yourself “How did I get here?” or “What the hell have I been doing with my life?”\nYou don’t necessarily have a bad life, but you find yourself in this prison of banality, this lukewarm lifestyle you just found yourself in over a period of time.\nMost people stay there. Everyone has dreams, but we settle for less. Not only do we settle for less, but we start to tell ourselves stories, rationalizations, about why we settled.\n“I’m content with what I have.” Maybe. I don’t know you. But maybe you’re hiding.\n“Life isn’t all about chasing your dreams.” Sure isn’t. But it’s definitely not all about spending the vast majority of your time doing things you don’t want — a job you don’t like, gaps of time lost with errands and commutes, a sliver of time on the weekend to enjoy yourself.\n“You have to be realistic.” People who say this don’t usually have a justification for why you have to be realistic. Need to feed your family? Easy solution, chase the dream on the side. Don’t have a bunch of money? You don’t need a bunch of money to follow a dream.\nEvery excuse and story you tell yourself has a rebuttal. And deep down you know you’re just suffering from doubt.\nI don’t know about you, but whenever I experience the feeling that I’m holding myself back, I find it deeply troubling.\nIn fact, it’s my secret to motivation.\nMy Personal Watershed Moment\nI have a story that bears repeating. And a message that bears repeating.\nMost people can’t remember the exact moment they decided to change their life, but I can. I was sitting in my ratty, literally ratty as there was a rodent in the wall, apartment. Specifically, sitting on my mattress with no bed frame that I got from an ex-girlfriend years ago because she was about to throw it out. Pretty sure there was a coil sticking out of it.\nI’d been watching a few self-improvement videos online. Little by little they were getting me all riled up. That day, after watching one of those videos, I stood up and yelled at the top of my lungs:\n“I’m not living like this anymore!”\nAnd then I just stopped living that way. Just like that. My circumstances didn’t change overnight, but my attitude did. I developed a level of frustration sufficient enough to change.\nThat’s the secret. Get extremely frustrated.\nYou have your Eckhart Tolles and David Hawkins of the world who will tell you that your desires are rooted in your ego and that you should just meditate, stay in the present moment, and enjoy life. That approach is valid and I encourage you to try it if you think it’ll help.\nMe? I used the ‘unhealthy’ route. And it worked.\nYou’ve heard this technique before, but how do you get it to actually stick? I try to think back to what happened and understand why I finally put my foot down after trying and failing over and over again.\nHow do you really, truly, genuinely get to the point where enough is enough?\nHow to Use Your Emotions to Your Advantage\nIn my case, I just finally let the feeling of frustration truly wash over me without trying to block it at all. I felt sad. I felt like I betrayed myself. It hurt, badly.\nIf you don’t let the weight of your past decisions weigh heavily enough, you end up in that state of limbo. You feel anxiety about your life almost every single day. You have a micro-dose of an existential crisis that’s painful enough to annoy you, but not painful enough for you to do anything about it.\nFind a way to goad yourself into changing your life. Fight fire with fire — rationalization with the cold hard truth. A lot of people tell me that they both love and hate my writing at the same time. Why? Because I poke, frustrate, and annoy on purpose.\nI could tell you that everything will be fine if you stay the same, but then I’d be lying.\nSure, you’ll be fine in the sense that your life won’t be some great tragedy, yes, but you’ll live the tragedy of banality so many find themselves in.\nEach passing day of your life you’ll be reminded how much of a wimp you are — just letting your life slip away, letting the opinions of others and your own self-talk construct a prison around your soul, letting something as trivial as lack of motivation keep you stuck in a perpetual loop of anxiety for the rest of your life.\nAm I being dramatic? I don’t know. You tell me. There’s the famous Henry David Thoreau quote about ‘quiet desperation.’ Think about that phrase. It sums up people perfectly. We’re all shoving down the screams. Desperate, but quiet — repressed, stunted, paralyzed, stifled.\nYou can feel the passive-aggressive energy wafting through the air of society.\nWhy not take things from passive-aggressive to aggressive-aggressive?\nBe aggressively honest with yourself so you can change.\nThe Only Two Choices You Have\nSociety will give you every outlet available to BS yourself. Will you take the bait or not?\nYou have so many different areas available to place blame, so many that you can spend a lifetime blaming everyone else but yourself. But then where will that get you? Stuck in limbo. And you know it.\nSo, be honest enough to have that uncomfortable conversation that sparks a change in your life. Once you have the source of fuel, you’ll channel it into something promising.\nFor me, it was writing. For you, it’s that ‘thing’ you deep down have always known you’ve wanted to do. It’s at the intersection of your talents and what the world wants. Maybe you have to do some digging and experimenting to figure out exactly what it is, but you have a sense of what it is in your bones.\nA sense. That’s the game of life right there. Following your sense instead of burying them. As much as you try to use that pre-frontal cortex of yours to create those rationalizations, your true brain — the one that controls your feelings, emotions, and senses — always knows the real answer.\nYou can bury it deep, but you can never totally hide from it or escape it. Why not get familiar with it?\nYou know what you want out of life. We all do. The answers are quite obvious. But we’re deathly terrified. That’s it. The trick isn’t to have no fear but to counterbalance that fear with a stronger set of emotions and actions.\nSo, think about it. Think about how you feel about your life today and what you’re going to, you know, do about it.",

        "title": "The Danger in Fake Positivity and Spiritual Bypassing",
        "description": "hese days, the realm of spirituality (and sometimes psychology) can feel fake. Instagram and other social media are jammed with influencer posts about positive vibes, about not allowing negative energy or thoughts to get to you, about surrounding yourself with only supportive, positive people.\nUnless you live in a bubble or on Mars, this is not only unrealistic, but also a recipe for never growing or truly learning who you are. If you attempt to transcend or avoid difficult experiences, you can remain emotionally stunted. Spiritually minded psychologists and teachers refer to this as spiritual bypassing. Like it or not, the ugly parts of our humanity are where growth can occur. In the words of Buddhist teacher, author, and nun Pema Chödrön:\nFeelings like disappointment, embarrassment, irritation, resentment, anger, jealousy, and fear… are actually very clear moments that teach us where it is that we’re holding back. They’re like messengers that tell us, with terrifying clarity, exactly where we’re stuck.\nMany emotions serve as flags indicating an opportunity for us to learn. Challenge, sorrow, change, discomfort, conflict, hatred, depression, and anxiety are paths to growth and change. We can explore and accept the parts of ourselves society urges us to keep tucked away. Painful or uncomfortable experiences enable us to grow past our current emotional and spiritual states.\nFake positivity can perpetuate a lot of the stigma around mental illness. Encouraging someone who has clinical depression to focus on the positive is not helpful and can actually do more harm. This advice can bolster the feeling that they are at fault because they cannot simply pull themselves up by the bootstraps. I tell people struggling with depression that they are more tuned in to real human experience and emotion than those pushing the positive-vibes-only agenda.\nClients don’t come to therapy or seek life coaching because everything in their lives is going wonderfully. They are stuck in a pattern chock-full of negative emotions, and they cannot seem to break free. Sometimes we need an unbiased third party to help us see what we are running from or challenge us to face what we are unwilling to feel. Friends and loved ones can’t do it for us; we have too many emotional ties. Doing this difficult work can lead to lasting change. It takes real courage to stop pretending you have it all together and shake hands with deep sadness or childhood trauma. (Yes, this is a plug for going to therapy. I can’t help it. I’m a therapist.)\nThe path of individuation asks for total integration of all facets of the self: good, bad, and ugly.\nSometimes there is nothing to do with or about these emotions. Sometimes we need to simply acknowledge these feelings—to sit with sorrow, resentment, or jealousy without trying to change the experience or pick it apart. We have to allow ourselves to unfold, to witness emotions flooding our system, to breathe into the places in our bodies where we are stuck. We experience a softening when we allow space for all emotions, not just those that feel good.\nIf we can allow ourselves the space and acceptance to be multifaceted, we will experience life to its fullest. Being human means facing suffering. There is no light without dark, no joy without sadness. If we don’t experience all feelings, we have no basis for comparison. If we run from certain emotions by staying busy, expressing fake positivity, or abusing mood-altering substances, we are cutting away half our existence. When we stop and honor difficult emotions, we have the opportunity to live fully and integrate all parts of ourselves. These feelings will torment us until we stop running from them—and from the truth of who we are.\nNext time you feel a sense of anger, fear, or sorrow, I challenge you to pause, get still, and remain quiet. Notice the feeling in your body and take a deep breath into that space. You might even place a hand on the spot—the chest, the stomach, the throat—where the emotion seems to reside. When you recognize these feelings, you truly honor your humanity. You may feel a loosening or a challenging emotion washing over you. But it will fade, like a wave that crashes on the shore before receding into the ocean.\nIt’s also important to own your feelings. No one can make anyone feel any particular way. It may seem like someone else is triggering us, but the source of discomfort is always within. Blaming your anger or resentment on someone else is a very easy way to bypass the inner work.\nThe path of individuation asks for total integration of all facets of the self: good, bad, and ugly. Don’t get discouraged by the difficult moments and emotions, and don’t push them away or diminish someone else’s experience by encouraging fake positivity. Uncovering and understanding the self is a lifelong journey that demands rejection of conventional attitudes and the mask of positivity. June Singer, noted American psychologist, put it this way:\nIt is an easy thing to say “be yourself” but quite another thing to know who you truly are. How can you be yourself if you do not know that self? Therefore, the process of individuation becomes a seeking after self-knowledge.",

        "title": "The Cure for Toxic Positivity",
        "description": "hen my dad was diagnosed with colon cancer at age 52, I was flooded with emails, calls, and in-person pep talks from friends and acquaintances. Anyone who’d ever met me, it seemed, was eager to offer up a platitude. “Think positive,” they told me. “It will be okay. He’ll get through this.”\nBut his cancer didn’t go away, and neither did the deluge of optimism that flowed over both of us — my dad, the patient, and me, his sole caregiver. It was wearing him down, and me along with him.\nDuring one visit, family acquaintances kept steering the conversation back to a supposed Amazonian miracle cure they’d read about. My dad should try it, they said. You never know. When I pointed out that he wasn’t exactly in a condition to travel to South America, they suggested I go hunt it down and bring it back.\nThat was when I finally snapped and asked them to leave.\nRelentless focus on positivity isn’t just ineffective. Research has shown that it’s actually harmful.\nI know they were well-meaning. Everyone who offered us encouragement was. I also know I’ve done the same thing over the years, insisting to loved ones going through a hard time that they should stay strong, that everything would get better. In the moment, confronted with someone else’s distress, it’s a natural instinct to try verbally willing it away.\nBut that relentless focus on positivity — what Kate Bowler, a Duke Divinity School professor and former cancer patient, described in her memoir Everything Happens for a Reason as “the tyranny of prescriptive joy” — isn’t just ineffective. Research has shown that it’s actually harmful.\nOne 2012 study found that encouraging people to push away their negative emotions often has the opposite effect, making them feel bad about feeling bad, in addition to whatever else they were already going through. A 2005 study found that relentlessly focusing on the positive during times of stress — what the authors call “avoidance coping” — increased the risk of depressive symptoms later on. And there are plenty of other examples out there pointing to the same conclusion: Forced positivity often leaves us worse off.\nIt can eat away at relationships, too. “Seeking out people who bring ‘positive vibes only’ will ensure shallow bonds,” says Cleveland-based therapist Karly Hoffman King, whose work focuses on trauma. Instead, the relationship becomes a performance of happiness. Difficult conversations, moments of vulnerability — all off the table. “People are left to deal with their feelings alone instead of seeking support,” says King. “Offering up toxic positivity like ‘look on the bright side’ or ‘it could be worse!’ often just makes the other person feel invalidated, creating a wedge between the two of you.”\nIn her work counseling cancer patients, Los Angeles-based health psychologist Stephanie Davidson often encounters family members who maintain a facade of positivity so extreme that the patient feels they can’t discuss their fear or the losses they’re experiencing. “Feelings that we don’t like are not the enemy, and there’s no research that says acknowledging those feelings will make medical conditions worse,” Davidson says. “However, there is research that says that those who are not able to get support from those around them tend to do worse.”\nWhen you’re watching someone suffer, though, how do you know when your well-intended support has become something more insidious?\nThe answer can be surprisingly simple.\nBe conscious of how your friends react to your encouragement\nIf what you’re saying makes them smile or perk up, you probably aren’t forcing positivity on them. If, on the other hand, words of encouragement shut down conversations or seem to make them withdraw, that’s a sign that your sunny attitude is misplaced.\nThink, too, about what they seem to need in the moment\nAre they asking for a pep talk? Or are they looking for a place to vent or cry? It can be uncomfortable to simply sit with someone else’s emotions, rather than reaching for a solution. But often, that’s what’s necessary. Shift your focus: Listen to understand instead of listening to respond.\nAsk questions that help your friend or loved one develop the story they’re telling\nSomething as simple as, “How did you feel?” can be validating. It lets them acknowledge and share their experience with the problem they’re facing. And then, instead of offering a positive cliche, say something that clearly communicates that you see what they’re going through. They can’t shut their eyes and pretend the problem doesn’t exist; show them that you won’t, either.\nIf a loved one is coping with a chronic illness, instead of, “It could be worse!” say, “That sounds really hard,” and ask if they want to talk about it.\nIf a friend is having problems in their relationship, instead of, “Cheer up,” say “What’s going on?”\nIf your significant other has blown a presentation at work, instead of “You’ll get past it,” say, “Wow, that’s rough. Tell me what happened.”\nThe common theme with all of these responses is that they keep the conversation going instead of shutting it down. Over time, I was more comfortable telling my family that this was what I needed from them: to be able to steer the conversation, even if it went someplace dark, and know that they’d see it through.\n“The world cannot be remade by the sheer force of love,” Bowler wrote in Everything Happens for a Reason. I learned that, too, while watching my dad struggle with a body that had turned on him. He passed away in 2014, four years after his diagnosis. I miss him every day, but empathy did, and still does, make it easier to bear.",

        "title": "Why Negative People Are Literally Killing You (and How to Protect Your Positivity)",
        "description": "New research says negativity is incredibly harmful and contagious, so how do you protect yourself from it?\nHappiness is something that we all strive for. While it’s nearly impossible to rid negative thoughts, people and situations altogether (we’ll always have good and bad days), we can choose to strip away the parts our life that bring us down and instead refocus that energy towards being the best versions of ourselves.\nAnd some of these biggest detriments to success we encounter come from toxic people.\nYup, we’ve all encountered that co-worker who acts like a Negative Nancy, or that acquaintance who bears a striking resemblance to Eeyore. While you know these types of people are no fun to be around, what you might not realize is that they can actually have incredibly negative effects on your health and success.\nScientific research indicates that negativity is contagious, akin to a cold.\n“Feelings circulate in patterns analogous to what’s seen from epidemiological models of disease,” reported Wired.\nQuite simply, no matter how positive of a person you are, negative people can affect your life, unless you take the right precautions.\nThe effects are also drastic. Research has shown that even a small amount of negative brain activity can lead to a weakened immune system, making you more prone to illness, and even lead to a heart attack or a stroke.\nNegative attitudes can also affect your intelligence and ability to think — according to Dr. Travis Bradberry, negativity compromises the effectiveness of the neurons in the hippocampus — an important area of the brain responsible for reasoning and memory.\nSo, how exactly do you rid yourself from unnecessary negativity, and protect yourself from these harmful effects? Here are some proven methods to adopt:\nFirst, it’s time to say ‘goodbye’\nDon’t wait until a toxic person in your life has brought you so far down that you forget how to get back up. You need to surround yourself with people who inspire you, encourage you and help you realize your potential.\nOprah Winfrey herself advocates this method and has said, “Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher.”\nLife is simply too short to be friends with toxic individuals — and plus, there’s a lot of great people out there.\nIf you’re looking to meet new like-minded positive people, consider volunteering — it’s not only a great life practice, but it’s a great way to surround yourself with happier attitudes.\nIf you’re encountering a negative crowd at work, consider getting a mentor. Throughout my career, I have always been fortunate to have several mentors who push me to dream bigger and expect more from myself. Mentors often have a larger vision for us than we have for ourselves, and their confidence in our potential inspires us to reach higher than we could have imagined on our own.\nThen, set limits (especially with complainers)\nGranted, there are people who you can’t eliminate from your life (at least not right away), like co-workers or bosses. Thankfully, there are some proven ways to protect your positive attitude from the influence of others, even if you’re stuck with them for 8+ hours a day.\nComplainers and negative people are bad news because they wallow in their problems. Often, they want people to join their negativity party. And, often we feel pressure to listen to these negative individuals because we don’t want to be seen as rude, but there’s a huge difference between lending a sympathetic ear and getting sucked into others’ negative emotional tornadoes.\nYou can avoid all this by setting limits and distancing yourself when possible. Think of it this way: if the negative person was smoking instead, would you sit there inhaling the second-hand smoke?\nNo — you’d distance yourself, and you should do the exact thing same with toxic people. A great way to set limits is to ask complainers how they intend to fix the problem. They will either stop their negativity or redirect the conversation towards positivity.\nChoose your battles\nDon’t engage every time someone irritates you or tries to bring you into their negativity.\nNot only will you be seen as argumentative, you’ll be welcoming the toxicity into your own space. Rather than argue, try to ignore any negative comments. For instance, when a coworker starts complaining, say you have work to do rather than changing your mind or pretending to agree with them.\nWork on your emotional intelligence and prevent the situation from escalating. Walk away from unnecessary conflict — you’ll be respected for taking the high road.\nMake someone else smile\nPresident Obama said that “if you go out and make some good things happen, you will fill the world with hope, you will fill yourself with hope.”\nThat’s more than just a pretty speech. Consider someone else’s happiness — the good news is that positive attitudes are also contagious.\nMultiple scientific studies have shown that paying it forward not only makes others feel better, but creates long-lasting feelings of joy within yourself, and can provide that much-needed boost to your overall mood.\nBring some donuts into work. Offer people coffee. Offer to help with a project. Do what you can to get the whole team beaming, and they’ll do the same for you.\nThe bottom line\nIt’s never too late to make alterations or transitions in your life. Is your job making you unhappy? Start looking for a new one! Address and understand the things that are controlling your unhappiness. By doing so, you can get to work on making the necessary changes needed to make your life as successful as possible.\n",

        "title": "The Positivity of Being Angry, Tired, & Fed Up: A Life Lesson From Rosa Parks",
        "description": "“I had no idea history was being made. I was just tired of giving up.” -Rosa Parks\nRosa Parks didn’t refuse to give up her bus seat because she was in a spectacular mood, or because she had an exceptionally rare gift for standing up to people, or because she possessed a superhuman level of fearlessness, or because she felt called by God to pick one particular seat, or because she magically knew everything would turn out okay, or because it was a good time to rebel.\nShe refused to give up her bus seat because she was tired.\nAn entire nation was transformed because a woman got tired.\nIn your quest for inspiration, never underestimate the power of your frustration. Instead of forcing yourself to feel inspired, maybe it’s simply time for you to get tired. This world could use a few more people who have the audacity to get fired up. Being a positive force for change has nothing to do with smiling naively at everything that happens as if the goal is to win points for how cheerful we look. To hell with guru-speak about how unenlightened it is to feel mad. Anger is as valuable as happiness in the hands of a creative person.\nClarifying misconceptions regarding her true motivation, Mrs. Parks made the following remark:\n“People say I didn’t give up my seat cause I was tired…No, the only tired I was, was tired of giving in.”\nThe problem with our world isn’t that people are too angry, or too tired, or too fed up. The problem with our world is that we aren’t angry, tired, and frustrated enough to stop settling for less than what we truly love, what we truly deserve, and what we truly have the right and responsibility to pursue. We get angry enough to criticize, but not angry enough to create. We get tired enough to give in, but not tired enough to give a good fight. We get fed up enough to bemoan our limitations, but not fed up enough to battle for our possibilities. We’re angry, tired, and fed up enough to pout, but not angry, tired, and fed up enough to push back.\nOur feelings of dissatisfaction and frustration aren’t the problem.\nAll emotions are capable of being assimilated into the creative process. Instead of trying to “purify yourself” of anger, explore the possibility of channeling your feelings along productive lines.\nFrustration, when bottled up and suppressed, corrupts the soul. But when it’s redirected away from what is unwanted towards what is wanted, it becomes a powerful constructive force.\nThe same fire that can burn a house can also be harnessed to cook a meal. Like the forces of nature, our emotional energy can flow in more than one direction and serve many ends. The next time your emotional fires are stoked, look at it as an opportunity to harness creative energy.\nIn the same way you might use a burning candle to light a dead one, actively seek out ways to transfer the spark of those emotions towards areas in your life that need to be ignited.\nWe are not left to choose between resenting our moods or being stuck with them. What we call negative feelings can function as our greatest allies in manifesting the life we desire when we learn to work with them and not against them.\n",

        "title": "The Most Motivational Statement Ever in 3 Words",
        "description": "The most motivational statement comes down to three words: “You’re gonna die.” I’m not trying to scare you — I’m being practical. You get one life and one chance to make yourself happy. Instead of sitting and complaining about not pursuing the things you want in life, do something about it.\nToo many people focus on other people’s happiness when they should be focusing on their own. Do you know why I like making other people happy and motivating them to succeed? Because I’m already happy. It might sound selfish, but the first person you need to make happy is you. (Then you can make other people happy.)\nI implore you to be honest with yourself and ask if the things you are doing will put you in a position to succeed. Not just in the business world, but in life. When you’re happy in life, you realize that how you make your money is much more important than how much you make.\nIn my early 20s, I spent an enormous amount of time surrounding myself with people in their 90s. Whether I met them while traveling or working in the wine industry, I would ask each one of them to tell me about their life. They all started with these two words: “I wish.” Some wished that they had worked harder, some wished that they spent more time with loved ones, and some wished that they did what they wanted to instead of listening to their parents. They wished, they wished, they wished.\nIf there’s one thing I learned hanging out with these old-timers, it’s this: There’s no better time to act than now.\nIf you’re in your early 20s, this is your moment. This is not the time to try to be practical and maximize your money so you can buy something flashy like a fancy car right out of school. This is the time to realize that you have a five-year window (give or take) for you to attack the life that you want to win. Travel with buddies and experience the world, start a band to hone your talents, or start networking while you’re still living in an apartment with eight other people. Since most of you have no major life commitments, this is the time to take the chance on the life you want.\nEven if you’re in your 40s, 50s, 60s, or older, there’s still time to make yourself happy. If you want it that badly, you can get it. Instead of retiring and taking up golf, maybe it’s time to triple down and really focus on what you want. We live in a world today where there is so much opportunity available to us, especially with the Internet. It gives us access to more ways to pursue the things that we care about the most.\nBottom line: We are all going to die someday. No matter your age, you have the time to make yourself happy. We’ve never had more opportunities open to us than now to create the life we want.\nI was compelled to write this post because it’s a reaction to what I’ve been observing over the past couple of years. There’s this tendency people have to pass over opportunities when they think they can just “come back to it later.” People are living their lives like they have unlimited time. We all know that’s not true.\nIf I can just get one person to change their behavior, have that one conversation, or take that one chance, I’ll be glad I wrote this. Because at the end of the day, we’ve only got one at bat.\n“You’re gonna die” should motivate you every morning to get out there and get what you want done. You get one life — one chance. The biggest poison we encounter as humans is regret, so stop making excuses and start making yourself happy.",

        "title": "How to Think About Your Career",
        "description": "If you had asked 22-year-old me what my “career aspirations” were, I would have looked at you blankly and then casually changed the subject to what programs you’d recommend to model cute 3D bunnies for a video game, or whether the writers of Alias would be so devious as to ship Sydney Bristow and Sark. \n\nIt’s not that I didn’t think about my career at all. I was ambitious — I wanted to be a part of something big. I wanted to be able to support myself financially and not worry my parents (as this was a high bar set at doctor, aka the “stablest of all professions,” I suspect they still secretly worry about this.) I wanted the kind of job where I wouldn’t be watching the clock every hour, daydreaming like Rebecca Black about Friday.\nBut beyond that, the specifics of “thinking about my career” was a giant grey cloud to me. It felt almost icky to be too career-oriented, like if you were, you were that kind of self-absorbed person constantly trying to game the system by sugar-coating the things you said to your bosses. Besides, at 22, I had taken my first job at a start-up where we were moving way too fast to sit down and idly contemplate the skills we hoped to learn. Who needs career conversations when you’re busy changing the world?\nHere’s the thing though: your career, like your life, moves forward whether you think about it or not. If you don’t think about it, then you’re putting faith in the winds. Maybe you’ll end up somewhere you’ve always wanted to go. Maybe not. Why take that chance when you can captain your own sails?\nHere’s what I wish I had known about getting a handle on my career earlier in life:\nYour career is defined by your skills and how you’ve used them, not by any external measure of your progress.\nIt’s common to think of your career as your level within the company, or how much money you make, or your title, or whether you were included in some prestigious group (a meeting of importance, an exclusive conference, a list of N under N, an award recipient, etc.)\nOften, I hear people say things like, “I’m interested in advancing my career. What do I need to do to get promoted?”\nThis is a perfectly valid question to ask, but I suspect what lurks beneath the question is the assumption that advancing one’s career = getting a promotion. I contest this quite heavily. In my opinion, it’s like equating being a good friend with getting invited to friend’s wedding.\nCertainly, the people who attend someone’s wedding are likely to be good friends. But you wouldn’t think that optimizing for getting an invitation to a wedding is the right way to go about being a good friend. In fact, it’s entirely the other way around. If you focus 100% on being a great friend to someone, even if you never once thought about being invited to their wedding, guess what. You’re probably going to get that fancy envelope in the mail.\nThe same is true regarding your career. If you focus exclusively on improving your skills and your impact to your organization (or to the world at large), the promotions, raises and accolades tend to come as a byproduct.\nThe reverse isn’t true. As an extreme analogy, you might have a terrible boss who tells you the way to get a promotion is to shut your mouth, fetch her coffee every morning, and do any busywork she assigns you. Now, maybe you check off these boxes and get a promotion. Cool. But would doing this actually help you in the long run? Would doing this teach you new skills and make you a more attractive hire for some other company down the line? Probably not. Maybe what happens is that you rise in the ranks of that company only to have it go bankrupt later on. (Hey, this isn’t unreasonable given the organization seems to possess questionable management practices). Post-bankruptcy, you realize you don’t have many marketable skills in this rapidly-changing economy, so it’s hard to get a job at a similar comfort level to what you had. Life sucks. You get bitter.\nSo don’t ask “What does it take to get a promotion?” Ask instead: “How can I be doing more to help make our customers (or would-be customers) happy?” Ask “What skills should I be developing to help me increase my impact?”\nEven if your current company has a broken promotion system, even if your company collapses tomorrow due to the winds of ill fortune, even if every external measure you hold yourself to — title, salary, affiliation, awards — goes out the window, your skills are forever. Nobody can take those away from you. No matter where you journey, your skills and your past experiences go along for the ride. This is why you shouldn’t worry too much if your career doesn’t follow some up-and-up external ladder structure. Are there instances where a new role with a pay cut and a title downgrade might unlock a treasure trove of new learnings and opportunities? Of course. Might you be better off in 10 years if you take a smaller position at a faster-growing company? Just ask Sheryl Sandberg.\nCareers are long, so invest into them where it counts.\nTreat your manager as a coach, not as a judge.\nFor most of my career, I had the mental model that my manager, like my teachers and professors of the past, was someone in a position of authority who took note of what I did and passed judgement on it. They determined whether I was or wasn’t doing well, what I needed more critical feedback on, and what letter grade or assessment I deserved.\nAs such, my modus operandi for interacting with my manager could be summarized in one neat statement: don’t come across as an idiot.\nThis meant that I’d try and act as if I had my shit together in front of him or her. I’d exude confidence and optimism, even when I wasn’t feeling it. I’d say “Oh, I’ve got it under control,” when they asked if I needed help with anything. There was no clearer evidence of personal failure than if my manager had to get involved in something I was responsible for. I read it as a neon sign brightly flashing Warning: employee not competent enough to take care of this task on her own.\nIt wasn’t until I had managed for many years myself that this mindset began to change.\nLook, your manager’s job (assuming she is a good manager) is to help you and the rest of your team get better results. From this perspective, it is completely logical that she should be invested in your career. When you do better, then by extension, she does better. Hence, your manager is someone who is on your side, who wants you to succeed, and who is willing to spend a good deal of time and energy to help you do that.\nCan you imagine a star athlete trying to hide their weaknesses in front of their coach? Would you tell your personal trainer, “Oh, I’m pretty fit, I’ve got it under control” when she asks you how she can help you achieve a better workout? Of course not. That is not how a coaching relationship works.\nIt’s precisely because I didn’t see my manager as a coach that I missed out on years of asking for and receiving training and feedback that would have helped me become better faster. Yes, of course, your manager still plays the role of judge. Yes, she can (and should) fire you if you can’t do the job, or do nothing but play Pokemon Go all day. But assuming you’re not unqualified or lazy or an asshole (and trust me, if you were, you’d know quite quickly), then your manager would like nothing better than for your career to be on a rocket-ship trajectory to the moon.\nYou don’t just need coaching when you’re struggling. I’m willing to bet that everyone who’ll take home gold at Rio will have a coach. A majority of them will probably credit good coaching as a critical factor in getting them to where they are.\nThe more honest you can be with your manager about your aspirations, your motivations, and where you’d like their help to improve, the faster you’ll move.\nCreate a mental image of yourself mastering the skills you most want to master, and believe that that is in your future.\nA few years back, I wrote about a little book that caught my eye at Safeway, an obnoxious little thing with faux wax seal, quill-pen script, the ancient parchment paper glowing as if with magical beams. The book loudly proclaimed: Get whatever you want. Discover the secret to life.\nSpoiler warning ahead, but this is what the secret to getting whatever you want turned out to be: if you believe it can happen, it will happen.\n(I know, I know. I too was hoping it would be something more along the lines of Burn a sprig of Douglas Fir at 11:23pm on the eve of the New Moon and bow three times to a fat armadillo.)\nAs trivial as the new-age tidbit of if you can believe it can happen, it will happen sounds, there is research that shows if you can create a clear visualization of yourself achieving the outcome you want, you prime yourself to act in a way that is consistent with what you imagine.\nMany years ago, when I was frustrated by all the things I struggled with and felt unequipped or scared to do in my job, I started a list of what I wished a future me would one day be able to waltz in and easily accomplish. This list is titled One Day, I will…\nNow, maybe seven or eight years later, this list is still up-to-date. I’ve added additional items throughout the years, but the more incredible thing is how I’ve been able to check things off. The skills that once seemed a distant dream when I was 25 or 26 now feel like second nature. And these proof points give me confidence that all the new items I am still adding will also happen. In 5 or so years, I’ll look back feeling great about having mastered those skills as well.\nGoing back to this list a few times a year gives me a deep sense of motivation and comfort. These things I can clearly visualize are totally doable. So do them I will.\nIf you’re curious what my list looks like, here is a snippet of items checked off through the years, and items that I am still working on:\nOne Day, I will…\n…\n✓ Not feel intimidated when I interview someone because I’m worried about what they think of me as an interviewer.\n✓ Not be nervous about a public speaking event in the days before it happens.\n✓ Feel comfortable speaking up in a meeting of > 5.\n✓ Publicly blog without stressing about what other people will think.\nSuccinctly and clearly be able to make the point I want to make in 3 bullets.\nRegularly be able to weave compelling stories and analogies into verbal explanations.\nHost large events where people have fun and I am not really stressed out.\n…\nYou own your career, and you have more of an ability to shape it than anybody else.\nThis is the last takeaway because no matter how many people are on the sidelines helping you, ignoring you, or working against you, your career — like your life — is your responsibility. Don’t blame your manager, your significant other, your friends, or your company if you don’t have the career that you want. All of these things are in your power to affect or change.\nIf you find it hard to wake up excited about going to work in the mornings, ask yourself why.\nIf you look back on your last six months and you can’t point to anything that’s been hard for you, question whether you are challenging yourself enough.\nIf you find yourself constantly looking for other people to tell you how awesome you’re doing, consider if you’re shortchanging your own growth and development.\nIf your manager is not giving you the support or coaching you’d like, tell her how you’d like to be supported or coached.\nIf working at your current company is not aligned with your long-term goals or values, consider making a move.\nIf you’ve never thought about where you’d like to be in three years, sit down and think about it.",

        "title": "How One Year of Microdosing Helped My Career, Relationships, and Happiness",
        "description": "Recently, I completed a one-year experiment in which I took microdoses of psilocybin — also known as ‘shrooms’ or ‘magic mushrooms’ — almost daily. My goal was to understand the impact it would have on my work, relationships, and mental health.\nI approached the experiment as a relative newcomer to the world of psychedelics. Until the last few years, I wasn’t the kind of person to take recreational drugs. That said, I’m invested in health, mindfulness, and personal growth. I’ve scored in the top 99th percentile for standardized tests, trained and competed in the Olympic sport of speedskating, and run a startup for one of my business idols. Over the last 14 years, to improve my life, I’ve used and refined everything from meditation, yoga, intermittent fasting, paleo, Bulletproof, ketogenic, triathlons, powerlifting, “lifestyle design”, the “digital nomad” lifestyle, “Getting Things Done”, the principles of rationality, and also, nootropics — or ‘smart drugs’.\nBy the time I was 25, I created a life I was proud of, all while sober. So my perspective on recreational drugs was that anyone dependent on them had major problems they were running away from. I never thought of drugs as conducive to growth.\nFortunately, I was wrong. After taking them in Southeast Asia, my perspective on psychedelics quickly changed, and they became a vehicle for greater self-reflection and awareness. Psychedelics appealed to me in their ability to work through painful emotions of the past. My use of psychedelics has shown various benefits, including reducing my social anxiety and addressing things that even I, a so-called self-improvement fanatic, hadn’t gotten around to facing within myself.\nI woke up after my first dose of mushrooms to find my lifelong fear of public speaking gone. After mushrooms, I was exposed to LSD and MDMA, and traveled to Peru for a series of Ayahuasca ceremonies. They worked beyond my wildest expectations. Psychedelics served as eye-opening means for cultivating meaningful personal insight. I healed from childhood traumas I didn’t even know I had.\nAt one point, I began wondering if there was a sustainable way to leverage the power of psychedelics on a daily basis. It was at this time I became eager to discover whether smaller doses could help improve my work, relationships, and mood.\nIn the first article of this two-part series on microdosing, I’ll share the findings I came across, both from my personal experiment and the existing scientific research on psychedelics. In the second article, I will share a step-by-step process for experimenting with and exploring microdosing.\nObligatory legal disclaimer: I’m not a doctor, psychiatrist, therapist, or mental health professional. The experiences and writing I share will be for education and harm reduction purposes, and does not condone the use of illegal substances. Please do not use any dose of psychedelics without medical supervision.\nImage for post\nThe Effect of Psychedelics on the Brain\nMy first goal was to discover whether the use of of psychedelic mushrooms would allow me to tap into a more effective and happier side of myself. And if so, what were the risks involved?\nMy journey to better understand the effects of microdosing led me through the labyrinth of data on psychedelics research.\nKey terms and definitions\nPsilocybin — The psychoactive ingredient in ‘magic mushrooms’, or ‘shrooms’. It is converted to psilocin, enabling it to cross the blood-brain barrier. Structurally similar to the brain’s naturally occurring neurotransmitter serotonin, the hallucinogenic effects of this substance last between 4–7 hours.\nLSD — Short for lysergic acid diethylamide, and more commonly known as ‘acid’. The effects of a typical dose (100ug) of this substance takes 8–12 hours to subside.\nMDMA — Also known as ‘ecstasy’, ‘E’, or ‘Molly’, the effects of this drug last approximately 3–5 hours. Pilot studies have shown that 83% of PTSD patients receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy no longer met the criteria for PTSD.\nDMT — Often regarded as the ‘spirit molecule’ for its ability to bring spiritually profound experiences. It is the active ingredient found in the ceremonial South American brew known as Ayahuasca, and not to be confused with 5-MeO-DMT.\nHallucinogen — A class of substances that includes psychedelics, along with dissociatives. Despite what the name would suggest, not all users experience visual hallucinations when under the influence (case in point: yours truly).\nTrip (noun) / tripping (verb) — commonly used terms referring to any experience of being under the influence of psychoactive substances. However, the term is usually reserved for moderate or higher dose experiences.\nSet and setting — A phrase coined by psychedelic pioneer Timothy Leary in 1964 to describe the conditions of a trip, which can affect the quality and safety of the experience. Leary defines set as the “preparation of the individual, including his personality structure and his mood at the time.” Setting is “physical — the weather, the room’s atmosphere; social — feelings of persons present towards one another; and cultural — prevailing views as to what is real.”\nThe research produced the following interesting findings, some of which debunk popular myths about psychedelics…\nPsychedelics promote neuroplasticity and make different parts of the brain more connected. In two studies on LSD, one published in PNAS Journal and another in Current Biology, participants’ brains were more interconnected upon intake of a small dose of LSD as compared to a placebo, as measured by fMRI scans.\nImage for post\nCredit: Proceedings of National Academy of Sciences (pnas.org)\nAbove: Scans show different sections of the brain, either on placebo (top), or under the influence of LSD (bottom).\nSimilar effects were found in neuroimaging studies of participants under the influence of psilocybin mushrooms.\nImage for post\nImage Credit: Journal of the Royal Society Interface\nAbove: Simplified, color-coded image of homological scaffolds, or graphical representations of neural connections in the brain, on placebo (left) and psilocybin (right).\n2. Psychedelics are possible treatment for addiction. One study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology indicated that a single dose of LSD can curb alcohol addiction. 59% of participants taking LSD reduced alcohol consumption, as opposed to 38% of those who didn’t. In another study published in the American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse, moderate to high doses of psilocybin in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was found to produce significantly higher smoking abstinence rates 6 months later than any other medications or CBT alone.\n3. There are published clinical studies about the benefits of psychedelics. Contrary to popular belief, there are over 60 competed and in-progress studies around the world (at the time of this writing) intended to investigate the potential of psychedelics. These studies track treatment of a range of mental health conditions, including PTSD in veterans, depression and social anxiety for adults with autism, and end-of-life anxiety in cancer patients. Although there aren’t any published longitudinal studies involving healthy individuals, there has been an increasing amount of support for psychedelic research of all kinds in recent years, supported by organizations like the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Science (MAPS) in the United States and The Beckley Foundation in the UK.\n4. Microdosing has been a practice documented as early as 2010. In The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide by psychedelics researcher James Fadiman, PhD., it was established that microdosing had already been practiced as early as the 2000’s, with surveys collected from microdosing users around 2010. The first scientific study on microdosing and its effects on creativity and cognition is in the process of receiving funding.\n5. Zero deaths involving psychedelics have been reported as a result of pharmacological fatalities or toxic overdose. Due to the low toxicity of LSD and psilocybin, deaths reported while subjects were under the influence of psychedelics are typically either due to inclusion of other pharmacological agents present in the dose, or exposure to physical danger while experiencing hallucinations (e.g. running into oncoming traffic). This is why the community advocates so strongly for a safe set and setting.\nImage for post\nThe Experiment: One Year of Microdosing Magic Mushrooms\nNote: For those who would like to skip the technical details, skim through the “results” section, then jump to the following section on “how microdosing impacted my life”.\nAvoiding placebo and expectancy effects\nBefore microdosing, I deliberately made myself naive to the effects that microdosing had on others who had tried it. To avoid biasing my experience with subject-expectancy effect, I, I specifically avoided reading about user-reported subjective effects. Instead, I reserved my research to clinical descriptions of biochemical effects.\nEffectiveness: Does it work?\nThe first question I wanted to answer was: is microdosing beneficial at all? I had my answer within the first week. I felt increases in awareness of my own emotions, and an easier time starting and holding conversations. I was in a slightly better mood than usual. I kept a journal to keep track of the changes, including the days I didn’t microdose, to make sure I wasn’t just fooling myself.\nDosages: How much is ‘good’?\nMeanwhile, I starting pondering other questions, like:\nWill a higher dosage lead to more of the same benefits?\nCould different dosages lead to different benefits altogether?\nAre there any side effects of certain microdoses?\nAbout a month after taking a ‘standard’ microdose (definitions and exact amounts listed below), I decided to test the effects of different dosages. I wasn’t in any particular rush — I wanted to understand the effects of microdosing under a variety of normal life circumstances . This experiment lasted over a year. There were 3 distinct phases, each with a different dosage range:\n0.15–0.2g (‘microdose’, as defined by Dr. Fadiman as one tenth of a therapeutic dose)\n0.2–0.4g (slightly higher than a microdose)\n0.5g (typically considered a ‘creative dose’)\nMeasuring and tracking\nSome people have recommended I use fancy apps, but I like to keep things as simple as possible. I first measured my dosages every morning before taking them. Then, I wrote notes and observations in timestamped emails to myself on my phone, and finally compiled those notes into objective results.\nTo make my subjective observations quantifiable, I applied numbered rankings between 1 and 5 for aspects of my experience, like anxiety, mood, and productivity. A score of 1 would mean low, a score of 5 would mean high, and a score of 3 was same as normal, as shown in the following key:\n1: extremely low\n2: slightly lower than normal\n3: normal (baseline)\n4: slightly higher than normal\n5: extremely high\nResults\nOn the lowest microdose (0.15–0.2g), I was in a better mood, less anxious, and not noticeably more or less productive.

In the social work environment, I was highly productive but also highly anxious. In the orderly, non-social work environment, I was also less anxious, but less focused, leading to lower daily productivity. I had higher highs and lower lows in mood in general. My daily averages:\nAnxiety: 3.43 (less orderly social work environment) and 3.17 (orderly non-social work environment)\nMood: 2.86 (less orderly social work environment) and 2.31 (orderly non-social environment)\nProductivity: 4.71 (less orderly social work environment) and 2.61 (orderly non-social environment)\nOn the highest microdose (0.5g), I was surprisingly much less anxious, in a better mood, and much more productive and effective at everything in general. However, this effect did not carry over to mundane errands or mechanical tasks, like assembling furniture. My daily averages:\nAnxiety: 1.41\nMood: 4.50\nProductivity: 4.07\nFurther discussion and studies\nMore details and analysis of the quantitative aspect of my microdosing experiments:\nThe Benefits of Microdosing — SF Peak Performance\nSub-Perceptual Doses of Psilocybin, A 12-Month Experiment — Quantified Self Global Amsterdam\nImage for post\nHow Microdosing Mushrooms Impacted My Life\nThe year I microdosed happened to be a particularly difficult one.\nI was recovering from some major career setbacks due to a series of unfortunate events involving a spinal injury that ended my Olympic speedskating career and impending identity crisis, as well as a case of sexual harassment by a male direct report, followed by retaliation and blackmail. This left me hunting for a new role and taking a pay cut to pursue jobs in other industries (a story that is unfortunately becoming increasingly common in this day and age of sexual harassment in the technology industry). Meanwhile, there were financial challenges in my family. I had plunged into a fog of depression and anxiety almost as dark as the suicidal depression I experienced during my teenage years. I don’t know how I could have made it through without microdosing.\nBy the end of the year, I had made a career transition that led to more than doubling my salary from the first job I took after the incident. I improved my emotional well-being and developed better relationships with the people around me. It didn’t solve all of my problems or make my life a rainbow-glittery world of unicorns — but it definitely made the days easier as I picked up the pieces of my life and started anew.\nImproving my relationship with myself\nIn my relationship with myself, I became more aware of my emotions in every passing moment, and could address them on the spot instead of letting my them build up. I was in a better mood. My mind stopped making up reasons for me to be unhappy, and instead focused my attention on the positive. Some days, a sense of inner peace would permeate my being.\nI was less self-conscious and more creative. Everyday, more ideas and insights would pop into my mind than I knew what to do with. I held a greater appreciation for the arts. My apartment went from minimalistic and drab to tastefully and beautifully decorated. My alone time went from dead silent to filled with music, song, and dance. Despite a lifetime of hating clothes shopping, I started to enjoy every part of the process. I took up a dance class, and went from being a robotic dancer to deftly ‘on point’. I joked and laughed more.\nOverall, my life became more emotionally attuned, social, happy, and carefree, and less rigid, serious, and fear-driven. Many friends of mine remarked that I was more relaxed and calm, and that I had more energy.\nRelationships with others\nI was more comfortable in public, and less anxious in conversations. Although I already considered myself open-minded and accepting, I became more tolerant and compassionate towards people. I would chat with convenience store owners, give smiles to strangers walking down the street, and once had a 4-hour conversation with my coffee shop baristas while I waited in an airport.\nAt work, I made small talk without getting overly self-conscious. I led meeting presentations without anxiety choking me up. I had better check-ins with my boss and clients, and they all seemed more impressed with my work than before. With the people close to me, doors of intimacy were opened where there were none before. I watched myself as I expressed both positive and negative emotions in ways that made people comfortable and at ease.\nOver the year I microdosed, I became a more empathetic, compassionate, and affectionate person. I began to live with more acceptance, gratitude, and presence of mind. My workaholic lifestyle turned into one of spontaneity, creativity, self-expression, and lightheartedness. I continued to live out my values, feeling even more connected than before.\nImage for post\nRisks and Downsides\nAs with any wonder drug, there were also a few downsides.\nLoss of focus and productivity on (some) tasks\nSometimes I would be so overcome by emotions that I wouldn’t be able to do my work. I wouldn’t be able to complete a simple task because the onslaught of feelings were begging to be acknowledged before I could move on. Sometimes it felt like I had to take two steps back for every step forward.\nEmotional overload leading to a negative impact on relationships\nOn occasion, microdoses would amplify my anxiety, instead of decreasing it. Sometimes, I couldn’t go on the train in public without trembling inside. With people close to me, sometimes my heightened sensitivity turned to impulsive reactions to situations. This drove people away. However, given an underlying case of PTSD stemming from relational trauma, my experience might be different from those of most.\nLuck will have it that I stumbled across a better dosing regimen, albeit perplexing, that would allow me to feel confident without the heightened emotional sensitivity. A small dose of around 0.20g would allow for a better mood, without the downsides. A slightly higher dose of 0.35g would make things harder, and I would begin to feel a creeping sense of paranoia. A dose of 0.5g would make me feel much better, and the side effects of the middle dosage would disappear.\nImage for post\nReflections & What’s Next\nMy one-year experiment with microdosing definitely changed my life for the better. My career, relationships, and happiness improved. In future experiments, I hope to investigate the effects of microdoses of LSD and other substances, as well as alternatives to psychedelics for creating the same positive changes. I’d love to learn about the benefits that microdosing has on other people, especially for different goals and challenges.\nMicrodosing has served as training wheels for helping my brain develop the necessary pathways that it needed to access on its own. Nowadays, I can reach those benefits without microdosing, while keeping the parts of my personality that bring me joy. With time, I won’t need to microdose on a regular basis forever, but just to use it on occasion, when I want to access more of my emotional experience. Ultimately, I hope to remain connected to all parts of my psyche without the help of psychedelics, but they’re always there if I need them.\nThank god — or, Mother Nature — for neuroplasticity.",

        "title": "The No. 1 Predictor Of Career Success According To Network Science",
        "description": "It has been over three years since Steve Jobs died.\nSince then, books have been written and movies have been made.\nEach has celebrated his legacy and aimed to share the secrets he used to build the largest company in the world; things like attention to detail, attracting world-class talent and holding them to high standards.\nWe think we understand what caused his success.\nWe don’t.\nWe dismiss usable principles of success by labeling them as personality quirks.\nWhat’s often missed is the paradoxical interplay of two of his seemingly opposite qualities; maniacal focus and insatiable curiosity. These weren’t just two random strengths. They may have been his most important as they helped lead to everything else.\nJobs’ curiosity fueled his passion and provided him with access to unique insights, skills, values, and world-class people who complemented his own skillset. Job’s focus brought those to bear in the world of personal electronics.\nI don’t just say this as someone who has devoured practically every article, interview, and book featuring him.\nI say this as someone who has interviewed many of the world’s top network scientists on a quest to understand how networks create competitive advantage in business and careers.\nThe Simple Variable That Explains What Really Causes Career Success\nIn December of 2013, I interviewed one of the world’s top network scientists, Ron Burt. During it, he shared a chart that completely flipped my understanding of success. Here is a simplified version:\nImage for post\nThe bottom line? According to multiple, peer-reviewed studies, simply being in an open network instead of a closed one is the best predictor of career success.\nIn the chart, the further to the right you go toward a closed network, the more you repeatedly hear the same ideas, which reaffirm what you already believe. The further left you go toward an open network, the more you’re exposed to new ideas. People to the left are significantly more successful than those to the right.\nIn fact, the study shows that half of the predicted difference in career success (i.e., promotion, compensation, industry recognition) is due to this one variable.\nDo you ever have moments where you hear something so compelling that you need to know more, yet so crazy that you’d have to let go of some of your core beliefs in order to accept the idea?\nThis was one of those moments for me. Never in all of the books I had read on self-help, career success, business, or Steve Jobs had I come across this idea.\nI wondered, “How is it possible that the structure of one’s network could be such a powerful predictor for career success?\nHow A Closed Network Impacts Your Career\nTo understand the power of open networks, it’s important to understand their opposite.\nMost people spend their careers in closed networks; networks of people who already know each other. People often stay in the same industry, the same religion, and the same political party. In a closed network, it’s easier to get things done because you’ve built up trust, and you know all the shorthand terms and unspoken rules. It’s comfortable because the group converges on the same ways of seeing the world that confirm your own.\nTo understand why people spend most of their time in closed networks, consider what happens when a group of random strangers is thrown together:\nImage for post\nDavid Rock, the founder of the Neuroleadership Institute, the top organization helping leaders through neuroscience research, explains the process well:\nWe’ve evolved to put people in our ingroup and outgroup. We put most people in our outgroup and a few people in our ingroup. It determines whether we care about others. It determines whether we support or attack them. The process is a byproduct of our evolutionary history where we lived in small groups and strangers we didn’t know well weren’t to be trusted.\nBy understanding this process, we can begin to understand why the world is the way it is. We understand why Democrats and Republicans can’t pass bills with obvious benefits to society. We understand why religions have gone to war over history. It helps us understand why we have bubbles, panics, and fads.\nThe Surprising Power And Pain Of Open Networks\nPeople in open networks have unique challenges and opportunities. Because they’re part of multiple groups, they have unique relationships, experiences, and knowledge that other people in their groups don’t.\nThis is challenging in that it can lead to feeling like an outsider as a result of being misunderstood and under-appreciated because few people understand why you think the way you do. It is also challenging, because it requires assimilating different and conflicting perspectives into one worldview.\nIn one of my all-time favorite movies, The Matrix, the main character, Neo, is exposed to a completely new world. Once he is, he can’t go back. He’s an outsider in the new group, and he’s an outsider in his old life. He’s had an experience that everyone he’s ever met would never understand. This same phenomenon happens when we enter new worlds of people.\nOn the other hand, having an open network is a huge opportunity in a few ways:\nMore accurate view of the world. It provides them with the ability to pull information from diverse clusters so errors cancel themselves out. Research by Philip Tetlock shows that people with open networks are better forecasters than people with closed networks.\nAbility to control the timing of information sharing. While they may not be the first to hear information, they can be the first to introduce information to another cluster. As a result, they can leverage the first move advantage.\nAbility to serve as a translator / connector between groups. They can create value by serving as an intermediary and connecting two people or organizations who can help each other who wouldn’t normally run into each other.\nMore breakthrough ideas. Brian Uzzi, Professor of Leadership and Organizational Change at the Kellogg School of Management, performed a landmark study where he delved into the tens of millions of academic studies throughout history. He compared their results by the number of citations (links from other research papers) they received and the other papers they referenced. A fascinating pattern emerged. The top performing studies had references that were 90% conventional and 10% atypical (i.e., pulling from other fields). This rule has held constant over time and across fields. People with open networks are more easily able to create atypical combinations.\nThe Revisionist Timeline Of Steve Jobs Success\nAs a result of pursuing his curiosity in different fields throughout his life, Steve Jobs developed an extremely unique perspective, skillset, and network; one that no one else in the computer industry had. He turned these unique advantages into the largest company in the world by having a razor sharp focus. Within Apple, he cut out people, products, and systems that weren’t world-class.\nImage for post\nMany are quick to label parts of Steve Jobs’ life as the ‘lost’ or ‘wilderness’ years. However, when we view his life in retrospect, we see that his diversions were critical to his success.\nWhat is labeled as the magic of Steve Jobs or the quirks of his character become replicable principles we can all follow.\nIt is from this vantage point that we can begin to understand the following quote from a Steve Jobs interview for Wired in 1995:\nCreativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something.\nIt seemed obvious to them after a while. That’s because they were able to connect experiences they’ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they’ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.\nUnfortunately, that’s too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven’t had very diverse experiences.\nSo they don’t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.\nStay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\nThroughout human history, all societies including our own have created myths that share one common element, the hero’s journey.\nHere’s what the journey looks like according to Joseph Campbell, the originator of the term…\nThings are going great. You feel normal and fit in. Then something happens, and you change. You start to feel like an outsider in your own culture. You hide parts of yourself to fit in, but that doesn’t help. You feel called to leave and fulfill part of yourself, but that has a lot of uncertainty. So, you hesitate at first.\nFinally, you take the plunge. You go through difficult times as you’re learning to navigate the new world. Finally, you overcome the challenges. Then, you go back to your old culture and have a huge impact because you share the unique insights you’ve learned.\nThe hero’s journey myth is embedded in everything from our society’s classic movies (i.e., Star Wars) to the heroes we glorify (i.e., Steve Jobs), because it hits on core parts of the human experience.\nThe field of network science shows us two things. (1) The hero’s journey is the blueprint for creating career success. (2) We can all be heroes. It just takes a little faith as you follow your heart and curiosity into unknown worlds. As Steve Jobs said, “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. ”\n— —\nOther Related Article By Me\nHow One Life Hack From A Self-Made Billionaire Leads To Exceptional Success\nWhy Being The Most Connected Is A Vanity Metric\nThe One Trait That Elon Musk, Ben Franklin, and Marie Curie Have In Common\nHow Being Unfocused Can Take Your Career To The Next Level\n— —\nI would love to hear your thoughts on how you build open networks!

        "title": "One of the biggest mistakes I’ve made in my career",
        "description": "Should designers in high-tech learn how to code?\nIt’s a question that has cropped up consistently over the past two decades, creating scores of heated debate at design conferences, as well as on every design website or blog you can find. I’ve also met many a young designer, just getting started in this business, stressing over whether they need to invest time learning HTML+CSS or Java or Objective C or Javascript.\nBefore I dive into my answer on the question, I’d like to relay a story about what I consider to be one of the biggest mistakes I’ve made in my design career. If I were able to wind back the clock twenty years, this is certainly one of the things I would change. No question. It’s a story I’ve told to numerous designers, and one that I tell young designers with the hope they don’t make the same mistake. It was Fall of 1995, about a month or so into my new job as the interface designer at Adobe Systems. I was spending a lot of time drawing up feature ideas as a way to get comfortable in my new gig. I started down a path of mocking up what it would look like if Photoshop, Illustrator, and PageMaker (later to become InDesign) shared interface conventions. If you don’t know what those products looked like back then, you can read this article from Design Graphics Magazine out of Australia, featuring yours truly, for a refresher.\nSince I was new to the Bay Area and knew only a handful of people, I spent most of my nights and weekends at Adobe HQ in Mountain View, cranking Nine Inch Nails and KMFDM at 11 while drawing and iterating incessantly. One particular weekend, I got to a good spot with my sketches and mockups. I opened up Macromedia Director and did what I had done many times before I joined Adobe. I started putting together a scripted demo of the screenshots come to life using Director and Lingo. I loved making things come alive in Director, and really got into what I could accomplish with simple scripting.\n#FunFact: The original version of MYST was scripted and built using HyperCard. #Humblebrag: I was an alpha tester on the original MYST, and was one of the first people to experience the game. And yes, no one spells my name correctly. Story of my life. I wrote scripts in my Director project so “menus” would open, showing proposed changes to terminology and keyboard shortcuts. I toggled “buttons” on and off and put cursors on the screen to mimic tool selections or palette behaviors. I made it possible to drag a “palette” around on the screen. (These things were often nothing more than rectangles filled with simple text or pixel perfect palette mockups inside them.) I had gotten enough basics and flow working with simple effects that I was about to embark on the process of scripting the tab palettes to mimic the collapse behavior, which only Photoshop had at the time. Basically, I started to make a lightweight prototype, one that did just enough to render my ideas with interaction instead of just static mockups — the equivalent of what some designers do today with Invision or Framer.\nTo back up even further for a moment, I should note that my design training actually started out in theater. At an early age, I had always intended to get involved with making movies, either as a director or as a production designer. I interned at professional theaters in the late 1980's, and cut my teeth on building and painting sets, hanging lights, and making scale models.\nBuilding models, drawing things to scale, rendering an idea before construction; these were all things that were simply part of the job in production design for putting on a show. I had been trained that before you ever attempt to build anything for production, you first need to draw out your idea, iterate through it, make a scale model of it, iterate some more, then build it and put it through a dry-run before you ever put it in front of a paying audience.\nIn other words, as far as I’m concerned, iteration and prototyping were never in question as a part of the design process. It still boggles me to this day how some people in tech find this to be some sort of revelation.\nBack to that weekend in 1995. I spent a solid 48 hours putting a lot of effort into Lingo scripts so that my mockups could come to life. So for example, rather than present an Excel spreadsheet of proposed menu changes, I could show co-workers interactive menus reorganized with shared product terminology to communicate the design. In fact, it only took me a few hours to put that part of the prototype together, and it forced me to work within the space constraints of screens from that time. If I had made a mistake somewhere or got feedback from the team, I could edit the script easily and rebuild the player in a matter of minutes. Drawing up all the menus for all the products — a task I wound up doing later — took at least three to fours times as long to do. Reworking those screenshots per revision took almost as long as well.\nI was quite happy with the beginning of that early prototype. I had pixel perfect mockups, and they were great at communicating the visceral impact of the changes I was proposing. But the prototype communicated the changes an order of magnitude better with interaction, which is exactly what prototypes are supposed to do.\nDuring the following week, I was working in my cubicle when one of the product managers came knocking. This product manager had been with Adobe for a decent amount of time, and they were well liked by most as near as I could tell. I was pretty excited about the prototype work I had immersed myself in, and was more than happy to show them what I was cooking up.\nWhen I clicked on the “menus” and they popped up in the prototype, or when I dragged a “palette” that had proposed content in it — say, the new Character Palette design—their eyes kind of lit up, thinking that I had done a lot of complex coding to get a prototype that looked so real up and running. Being at the company for a very short period at that point, I took their reaction as a sign I was doing the right thing, and I was certainly more than a little proud of myself for that.\nBut then it happened.\nThis product manager, while very excited that I was building up this prototype, paused a moment. “Andrei, this is certainly very cool. We’ve never had anyone go to this length to propose any new designs or changes. But I have to wonder… How long did it take you to make it?”\nI shrugged. “Not long. Just the weekend and a few days since.”\n“Well,” they continued, “while I certainly applaud your effort, I must say that you really don’t need to go to this length. You’ll have to do this all the time for all the products going forward. These screenshots you have here are plenty. It’s all we’ve ever done before, so there’s really no need to spend this kind of time on a prototype.”\nNext came the mistake. Like I said, one of the biggest ones I’ve made in my career. It’s burned into my brain as if it happened five minutes ago.\nI simply said, “Um… Ok. I guess. If you think so.”\nI never built another prototype while working at Adobe again.\nI’m not pointing fingers, and certainly don’t blame anyone but myself for this. I could have easily ignored the product manager’s advice and stayed the course with my trained design process and built out my prototype. No one at Adobe ever forced me to work in one particular way, and no one would have stopped me. One of my favorite aspects of the culture there was how everyone was given a lot of room to work in the way that was most effective for them.\nHowever, I did not follow through on making prototypes as part of my job, and it took me quite a bit of time to get back into scripting and coding after that day. I worked for Adobe for five years after that, in the trenches, designing what would become the Creative Suite. I left in the early aughts to take a crack at the web thing, but had let my scripting and coding skills lag heavily. They had been dulled and took another five or so years to get back into even mediocre shape with basic scripting tech. In short, it took about ten years to recover from that day, and I still suffer today from having too many gaps in my coding knowledge base that I have to refill. I can only imagine how much farther along I’d be if I had stayed the course and kept learning and practicing my coding skills while technology evolved over the past twenty years.\nCompounding the mistake is knowing now that I had the good fortune to be the first interface designer at Adobe; I could have instilled a culture early on of designers building and prototyping in collaboration with engineering, learning how to code, and how to work with one of the critical materials in our chosen profession. I missed that opportunity, only fully realizing how big of a mistake it was years later.\nSo, back to the question at hand: Should designers in high-tech learn how to code?\nAnswer: Absolutely. Especially if you want a career in this profession.\nBonus Answer: HTML+CSS is not coding. It’s basic scripting. Just learn how to do it. It’s easier than learning how to use Sketch or Photoshop quite frankly, especially a full decade or so after web standards have settled in.\nDouble Bonus: Spend your time learning Javascript. Ignore everything else until further notice or until you have mastered Javascript. (All the top engineers I know in this business have given me this advice recently, so I’m passing it along.)\nYou’ll absolutely need to learn how to code if you want to make designing technology products your career. Without learning how to code, all you can hope to have is a really good job. A very rewarding and high paying job, mind you, but in the end, a job.\nA job is something that is often at the whim of market forces, quarterly company earnings, and short term product trends. A job is something where someone else will ultimately control some aspect of what you do, and you should set your expectations about the job accordingly. A job is that thing that winds up being how you spend ~40 hours a week to earn a living, but more often than not you can’t wait until the weekend to do the thing you really want to do.\nA career is something you pursue for decades, hopefully over an entire lifetime. A career fulfills and rewards you in a way that money or your position in the company org chart cannot. A career is one of the things that will make your heart ache knowing just how much you’ll miss it when you eventually kick this mortal coil.\nIf you want a career in design making digital products, then you should do whatever you can to train up in the art of code. Further you’ll enjoy it in ways you cannot possibly imagine until you have some of that knowledge under your belt. Knowledge that gives you the power to make things with your own two hands. And isn’t that one of the reasons why you became a designer? To bring into creation that which was not there before?\nIf there’s any kind of addiction you’ll experience as a designer, I guarantee it’s the rush you’ll get after making something with your own two hands that didn’t exist in the universe until you made it. Getting someone else to make it for you is certainly rewarding, but it’s not nearly the same experience.\nIt’s the difference between the experience of sitting in a racing car as the passenger versus being behind the wheel.\nIt’s the difference between enjoying fifteen minutes or so indoor skydiving versus actually parachuting out of a plane.\nIt’s the difference between feeling really good, even great, about your work versus kicking ass and taking names.\nMaking something with your own two hands is a super power. Why on earth would you willingly rob yourself of it?\nCode is a critical component in creating digital products. Not understanding how it works means at best that you’re flying blind on the job. Being able to do a minimal amount — like knowing how to write HTML+CSS — certainly gives you an appreciation for what some of your engineering counterparts have to do to make even the simplest of designs real. But in the end, even that won’t cut it over the long haul.\nKnowing how to code? As in, taking a deep dive into Javascript or Objective C or Java? That’s where it’s at. And as long as people have to code to make digital products, that’s where one of your coolest super powers as a designer in tech will come from. All you have to do is embrace it.\nOnce you do that, here’s the really good news:\nYou have an entire career, decades even, to learn how to code!\nSure, everyone wants to be a master coder in two weeks, or lose twenty pounds in seven days, or play the guitar without ever having to practice. Taking time to learn something that is possibly out of your comfort zone — weeks, months, or years — can be a scary proposition.\nBut this isn’t a pipe dream.\nThis is your career we’re talking about.\nYou’ll need to nurture it and grow it and love it over the next few decades. There’s no time to be worried if you’ll ever get it, or if you’ll ever be any good at it, or if you have too much work to do already in your day to day affairs.\nJust let go and dive in. Right now.\nLooking back on it, I promise you that you’ll be amazed at how much more accomplished you’ll feel. You’ll realize how much more you were able to do — not less — by having that skill in your arsenal. You’ll probably reflect back on it and tell yourself, “Yeah... I kicked ass and took names!”\nAnd like all people with super powers, you’ll feel the same way: Really damn good.\nDon’t let anyone ever talk you out of it.",
        "summary": "It’s all we’ve ever done before, so there’s really no need to spend this kind of time on a prototype.”\nNext came the mistake. If there’s any kind of addiction you’ll experience as a designer, I guarantee it’s the rush you’ll get after making something with your own two hands that didn’t exist in the universe until you made it. However, I did not follow through on making prototypes as part of my job, and it took me quite a bit of time to get back into scripting and coding after that day. One of my favorite aspects of the culture there was how everyone was given a lot of room to work in the way that was most effective for them. Once you do that, here’s the really good news:\nYou have an entire career, decades even, to learn how to code! No one at Adobe ever forced me to work in one particular way, and no one would have stopped me. Just the weekend and a few days since.”\n“Well,” they continued, “while I certainly applaud your effort, I must say that you really don’t need to go to this length. If I were able to wind back the clock twenty years, this is certainly one of the things I would change. I had been trained that before you ever attempt to build anything for production, you first need to draw out your idea, iterate through it, make a scale model of it, iterate some more, then build it and put it through a dry-run before you ever put it in front of a paying audience. They had been dulled and took another five or so years to get back into even mediocre shape with basic scripting tech. I was spending a lot of time drawing up feature ideas as a way to get comfortable in my new gig. To back up even further for a moment, I should note that my design training actually started out in theater.",

        "title": "Don’t Pick A Career — Create One",
        "description": "One of the most important career lessons I’ve learned is to pursue a career and not a job. At first glance, you might think, “What’s the difference?” I also didn’t get it for years.\nThat’s how I finally ended up in an IT job that I wasn’t passionate about. At one point, I was reflecting on my career and life by writing in my journal and thought, “How on earth did I end up in this job?”I didn’t have a good answer. All I knew was that I felt stuck and lacked any future perspective. If you have ever been in that position, or are in it right now, you know that it’s depressing.\nHow Conscious Are Your Decisions?\nIf you would ask me “how did you end up in your current job?” four years ago, I would tell you this: “It just happened.” It’s a common answer to that question.\nLooking back, I realized that I never made conscious decisions about my career until that point.\nWe all believe we’re Independent and that we make our own decisions. But that idea about ourselves is false. The truth is that we chase things like money, status, job titles, promotions, corner offices, respect from our peers, you name it. All external factors.\nWe must stop putting our careers in other people’s hands. We must take control by making conscious decisions.\nRalph Waldo Emerson, one of the most conscious thinkers of all time, said it best:\n“The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.”\nImage for post\nWhat Career Do You Want?\nMost of us don’t know what we want. I also didn’t know exactly what I wanted for many years. At least, that’s what I told myself. Deep down, I knew damned well what I wanted to do. It’s what I’m doing right now: writing, teaching and speaking.\nUntil four years ago, I was simply too afraid to pursue this career because of one thing: creating a career is hard.\nI believe that we all have something we love to pursue. Whether or not that’s something we actually end up doing for the rest of our lives doesn’t matter.\nWhat matters is that we consciously decide to pursue a particular career. And that we don’t pick a job because we need the money. Or because our parents want to.\nJust like Emerson said, you decide who you become. After successfully creating my own career, I’ve identified 5 steps that can help you to get started.\n1. Analyze yourself\nI’ve never met a successful person who did not build a career on their strengths. It simply does not exist. No one can perform well by doing something they are bad at.\nSure, you can improve your weaknesses. But it’s not an effective strategy. Like Peter Drucker says in Managing Oneself:\n“It takes far more energy and work to improve from incompetence to mediocrity than it takes to improve from first-rate performance to excellence.”\nSo figure out how you perform. Identify your strengths. Then, go to the next step.\n2. Identify an industry that fits your strengths\nThis is a tough one. On one side, I believe that we should pursue a career we are passionate about. But on the other side, I think we should NOT do something we’re bad at.\nSo what should you do if you love something but suck at it? My opinion is to not pursue a career in that field. Treat it like a hobby instead. A lot of people love to make music, but they are not good enough to earn a living. But does that mean you should stop making music? Hell no! Go and jam with your friends — in your spare time.\nThe bottom line is this: Only pursue a career that fits your strengths. I know this is somewhat of a limited view. Some people even call it pessimistic. But I see it as realism.\nWe all have bills to pay and people to take care of. We can only do that by making a living. But that doesn’t mean we should do work we hate. There is always an industry that you love and that fits your strengths.\nAnd you know what? Like Cal Newport argues in So Good They Can’t Ignore You; eventually, you will love the work you’re good at.\n3. Improve your universal skills\nJust being good at your job doesn’t cut it. To truly make an impact in the workplace, you need what I call “universal skills.”\nSkills like writing, leadership, personal effectiveness, and persuasion are helpful to all professionals. Whether you are a coder or carpenter, you want to provide value to others. To keep doing that, you need those universal skills.\nThe earlier you start improving your universal skills, the more likely it is that you will be ready when you get an opportunity.\nWant to learn more about improving your skills? Watch this video:\n\n4. Start at the bottom\nI never understand why people are so impatient. No one ever became successful by starting at the top. That’s simply not how life works.\nJust look at all the kids with rich parents who give them everything. Those kids often don’t understand the value of hard work and how hard it is to make a living. There’s no honor in getting a free pass.\n“But don’t you want to take the fast lane of life?” Some people might argue.\nYes, of course. I’m all about personal effectiveness and achieving better results in less time. But I’m not about quick fixes and unrealistic expectations. For the first three years after I started my first business in 2010, I made virtually no money. And I even moved back to my parents for the first two years, so I had no expenses.\nAll the money we made went back into the business. And I worked on the business 7 days a week. It’s the same when you start or switch careers.\nYou might not see any benefits during the first few years. It’s a hard concept to grasp. Because you also don’t want to waste your time. That’s why I always warn people; if you’re seeing 0 results, you’re doing something wrong.\nWhen I didn’t pay myself at our business, the business itself was growing. You see? I’m not saying, “Put your head down and work yourself to death.”\nNo, you still have to be smart. If you don’t see any results, be hard on yourself. But always be willing to start at the bottom. Forget about your ego. No one is good enough to do certain things. And at some level, we’re all students. It’s the only sustainable strategy if you want to achieve sustainable career success.\n5. Keep developing yourself\nOne thing I always notice when I talk to successful people is how excited they are about the future. Have you ever experienced that as well?\nAnd it’s true. There’s nothing more exciting than the rush you get when you get new ideas or when you daydream about the future.\nAt the same time, when you have no outlook on the future at all, you feel stuck and depressed. Am I right?\nWe’ve all been there. There’s nothing more discouraging than being stuck at a dead-end job. That’s why we must always keep learning. We should never, for a single moment, get comfortable with our current job.\nEvery day, we must learn and develop ourselves. And before you go out and say it, I will: “That’s hard!”\nIt’s much easier to work 9–5 and spend the rest of the evening on the couch, watching tv shows, movies or playing video games.\nYou and I both know that a fulfilling career doesn’t come for free. The price is hard work and effort. I’m willing to pay that; what about you?",

        "title": "The Single Piece Of Advice That Changed The Course Of My Career",
        "description": "When I started my last corporate job, I asked experienced co-workers for advice and best-practices, and most of them told me something like: “Try to get in front of important people.”\nThat’s corporate code for sucking up.\nIt wasn’t my first time working for a large company. I’d seen a lot of suck ups get promotions in the past, and in a moment of weakness, I decided to listen to those idiots.\nYou “get in front of important people” by scheduling unnecessary meetings with random people, always saying something during meetings, pretending you’re working while you’re watching YouTube videos, and staying at the office until late when you’re not productive at all.\nBut sucking up didn’t feel right — I just couldn’t do it. It’s not my style. But it’s so tempting do it because people get rewarded for that type of behavior. It’s important to be seen working.\nAlso, who doesn’t want to get promoted? So you get lured in. That’s why I understand why people who start at corporations decide to play politics—you think it’s normal.\nBut “get in front of important people,” is horrible advice. Anything that is close to that, like “fake it till you make it,” or “just network your way up,” is also bad. It’s all based on appearances.\nThank god there’s another way to get rewarded.\nI was lucky enough to finally meet a stand-up guy. He was a new VP in another department. We met at the elevator, talked a bit, hit it off, and decided to schedule some time to properly meet.\nI thought he was very honest and confident, so I told him about the “getting in front of people” thing, and asked his opinion. Also, we had no ties nor mutual interests—i.e. no politics.\nHe said: “Stay out of the chit-chat. Do your work. Let your results speak for you.”\nHe said that he never played politics and he never applied for a manager role. He worked hard, people recognized his results, and THEY came to him with opportunities.\nThat’s the best piece of career advice I’ve ever received. It’s good because it’s simple. And it works for every single industry.\n“Big ideas are usually simple ideas.” — David Ogilvy\nBut it’s also tough advice for people to take. It’s uncertain: Do your job and hope for the best. You get rewarded when you work hard.\nIt’s like when people say: “Good things will come in due time.”\n“Yeah, right! I want to see instant results.”\nYes, and the kid wants his candy NOW. Calm down, honestly.\nI get it: We’re obsessed with quick results and blueprints. We want people to tell us: Do X, and you will get Y.\nBut unfortunately, things are not that simple. Over the past few months, thousands of people joined my newsletter, more than a million read my articles — and from that exposure, I got new opportunities.\nWant to know my exact blueprint? I HAVE NO IDEA.\nI just do my work and I don’t procrastinate. I’m also not a magician. I can’t trick people to read my stuff or work with me.\nNo matter how many marketing hacks you use, A/B tests you run, meetings you schedule with important people, or meetups you visit — if you keep wasting time on appearances, you never get better at what you do.\nInstead of always trying new things, appearing busy, or doing things that are not essential, try to keep things simple. Focus on your core competencies, and improve that. No gimmicks, just real work.\n“Quit or be exceptional. Average is for losers.” — Seth Godin\nIn the end, this is the best and simplest career advice I ever got: Do your job well (you don’t even have to be the best in the world, to start; be better than average people). That’s the ONLY career advice you need. And the results will come.\nIf they don’t, let me know, so we can go back to sucking up. But I’m pretty sure that will never happen. For now, let’s get back to work.",

        "description": "Sometimes I wake up, sweating, and I feel a dark fear around my heart. What if that money doesn’t come in to pay the next month rent? The anxiety is followed by shame.\nA distant voice from the past slaps me in the face with the fact that I don’t own a house or have much savings. A man of my age must have made his wins in our Western society. He should be on the “safe” side. Own assets that work for him after working to achieve those assets.\nTo make things worse, I just started a new career, as an artist.\nAre you kidding me?\nThat’s how the voice cynically pokes me. I know this reality check isn’t helping me at all, it is a very bad start of the day.\nUntil I open my bedroom door and walk onto the balcony on the front side of the villa, take the 180 degrees panoramic sea view in while stretching my arms towards the blue sky. I greet my 6 wild cats and walk around the house naked since there is nobody around. I live in a natural park in Ibiza and am not a millionaire.\nI do have some millionaire friends. One of them told me recently that I am really a millionaire. Since I seem to have time for everything, do genuinely what I like, live a very healthy life, travel the world and am surrounded by beautiful souls.\nRewind. How did I do this?\nThe secret is in my life's motto.\nI only do what gives me joy, follow my flow as much as possible, I do work hard and I trust life's abundance fully.\nThis is the part where I could ask you to subscribe to my free Ebook “The Seven Steps For Becoming A Millionaire Without Money”. But it is only half of the story.\nIt was pain and letting go that brought me here.\nAs much as my positive mindset helped me, it was how I dealt with the severe losses in my life. How transforming my pain into bringing beauty to the world saved my ass and made me see what really counts in life.\nI needed to do the work, as everybody does.\nLet me show you how it is possible to be a millionaire without much money. To live your dream by letting go, find your unique purpose by stepping outside the box.\nLetting go\nThe hardest part of moving to Ibiza was letting go of friends and family. The second hardest part was letting go of my complete career. Everything I had built up in Holland for 20 years.\nI was dead scared and pissed my pants when I walked on the stage of my own festival and announced that next year would be the last edition. I had told nobody in advance. I just announced the end of my career in the Netherlands. Age; 44.\nI was in Ibiza the week before and had fallen in love with the island Immediately.\nI was about to leave everything, my network, my reputation, my two rented houses and fancy coupe Cabrio car. I was ready to let my success go for a new adventure on an Island that I had visited only once.\nThe funny thing is that it wasn’t a midlife crisis.\nI had built my arts management career by following my life’s motto. I enjoyed every part of it. I worked hard, wrote all those project proposals, had years of little to none income, followed my passion.\nThen the breakthrough came.\nI believe when you show up continuously and believe in yourself there will be always breakthroughs. I met the Queen of Holland with one of my projects and made it to national TV.\nI was rocking it. And still, I left.\nI had no idea how to make money in Ibiza, but I had a dream. I wanted to write a novel.\nThe amount of growth you will experience in your life depends on how much uncertainty you can handle\nIt wasn't all fireworks and bubbles in the beginning, not at all. I realized I needed to start a new career while at the same time letting go of the old one with all that I had accumulated.\nBut that was nothing compared to letting go of my family.\nIn my first 4 years on Ibiza my father died and two years later my sister. I needed to take many flights back and forth to be there for them. Until our final goodbye.\nI had found paradise but was crying and mourning inside.\nThe pain of family dying, of letting go of a former life, taught me to be humble. I was still alive. It brought me immense gratitude for every-single-day.\nThe process of letting go strips you naked in front of your destiny\nIt shows you what you really need.\nWhen you are able to truly let go of what does not serve you anymore, freedom awaits you just around the corner of your true dream. All you need to do is to follow the breadcrumbs of what gives you joy.\nWriting always came naturally to me. I gave my mother a poetry bundle when I was 8 years old.\nI was getting ready to write my novel.\nImage for post\nPhoto by Dustin Lee on Unsplash\nHow experiencing the present moment is the key\nThe letting go lesson taught me this. Life had stripped me from all the unnecessities. I lost all that I cared for and was left with the one thing that has the most value to each and every one of us: Life itself.\nThe present moment.\nWhat does staying in the present moment actually means?\nIt means how you deal with your old conditioning. The voice in your head that comes from your culture, that tells you to make those 8 hours a day, to find security, to build up a pension. The voice that tells you that there is a lack of time and money and makes your heart contract in a daily race to accumulate more in competition with others.\nMy new friends in Ibiza truly helped me to experience that present moment more and more. To face those voices in my head just listen to them and connect to a deeper trust.\nLife has already brought me to a millionaires lifestyle without having much money, what would be next?\nI developed a sincere curiosity to live itself. Instead of planning a week ahead, I started getting a lot of joy in the synchronicity taking me by surprise.\nIn that silence, honouring of the moment I took up my pen and started working on realizing my dream.\nI wrote my debut novel in 3 months. It took me another 1,5 years to self publish it. I did it. I showed up every morning, often at 5 AM, and wrote my 2000 words. Every-single-morning.\nHow to let go of old conditioning?\nTo let go of your conditioning is much harder than letting go of material stuff. Since it is part of our culture, our consensus, what our parents and teachers told us. I can be deeply ingrained in our subconsciousness.\nTo let go of your conditioning, you need to first become aware of it.\nWhen you live inside the matrix and you are not aware of it, you will have your own daily challenges and rewards and setbacks. Nothing wrong with that. The matrix gives security, a pension, a life that rolls out pretty much the way you would expect it. You can chase as much as success as you like. You fit in.\nThe moment you get aware that you are actually living inside a matrix, everything might change for you.\nEspecially when you start questioning everything. That is the start of letting go. Sometimes referred to as awakening.\nIn Holland, I questioned myself every day if this was it! The life that I really wanted. Even in the midst of the opportunities, nice girlfriends, ski holidays and being busy, self-employed and socially successful, I asked myself that question.\nThe answer always was, deep inside, that there was more to explore. It was the genie in the bottle that came out when I discovered Ibiza.\nThe decision to follow my deeper dream made me high and at the same time, I felt I bungy-jumped into the deepest canyon of uncertainty. Without having a safety rope.\nWhen you feel the same when you consider giving up that job that gives you the security you thought you need, ending that relationship that you held on to because of fear of being alone, re-assessing what success really means, you are on the right track.\nYou will have your own rhythm, your own bandwidth of capacity to let go. Realize this: there is no true letting go without doing that Bungy jump.\nImage for post\nSunset from my Balcony. Photo: Lucien Lecarme\nWhen I sit on my balcony watching another stunning sunset I am flooded with gratitude. For this place, my friends, this life and even my pain.\nPain and letting go have brought me here.\nThe process of transformation is unique for each and everyone of us. I learned, however, that there are certain steps that the book of life teaches us about self realization.\nOne of the main chapters is about letting go. Sometimes life forces you to let go, sometimes you can decide yourself. Letting go can hurt like hell.\nToo many people hold on to money fiercely as if it is the holy grail to fulfillment. This comes from conditioning. Our culture and system throw us in competition with each other over scarce money. This makes us feel there is never enough.\nWe think we need money to survive but in reality the universe always will have your back\nMoney brings security and safety. But why make it the goal of your life? It comes and goes, like the waves, I am watching right now beyond the cliff.\nLet go of what you don’t need, be generous, become aware of the matrix and your conditioning, become clear about your purpose and embrace your deepest dream. Life will show you where to go next.",

        "title": "I Suffer From Depression and Have PTSD Symptoms",
        "description": "About four months ago, I contacted the VA to get help. It had been about 11 years since I left Afghanistan as an Army Intelligence Officer, and my tour over there still impacted me every day. So many men and women who served our country did so much more than me and were in so much more danger than I was on my four-month tour. I can’t have PTSD, I told myself, because I didn’t earn it.\nBut, on some level, I knew something was deeply wrong, and that it hadn’t felt that way before my deployment. After 11 years of this, I finally took a step toward dealing with it, but I didn’t step far enough.\nI went online and filled out the VA forms, but I left boxes unchecked — too scared to acknowledge my true symptoms. I knew I needed help and yet I still stopped short. I was afraid of the stigma. I was thinking about what it could mean for my political future if someone found out.\nThat was stupid, and things have gotten even worse since.\nBy all objective measures, things have been going well for me the past few months. My first book became a New York Times Bestseller in August. Let America Vote has been incredibly effective, knocking on hundreds of thousands of doors and making hundreds of thousands of phone calls. I know that our work is making a big difference. And last Tuesday, I found out that we were going to raise more money than any Kansas City mayoral campaign ever has in a single quarter. But instead of celebrating that accomplishment, I found myself on the phone with the VA’s Veterans Crisis Line, tearfully conceding that, yes, I have had suicidal thoughts. And it wasn’t the first time.\nI’m done hiding this from myself and from the world. When I wrote in my book that I was lucky to not have PTSD, I was just trying to convince myself. And I wasn’t sharing the full picture. I still have nightmares. I am depressed.\nInstead of dealing with these issues, I’ve always tried to find a way around them. Most recently, I thought that if I could come home and work for the city I love so much as its mayor, I could finally solve my problems. I thought if I focused exclusively on service to my neighbors in my hometown, that I could fill the hole inside of me. But it’s just getting worse.\nSo after 11 years of trying to outrun depression and PTSD symptoms, I have finally concluded that it’s faster than me. That I have to stop running, turn around, and confront it.\nI finally went to the VA in Kansas City yesterday and have started the process to get help there regularly. To allow me to concentrate on my mental health, I’ve decided that I will not be running for mayor of Kansas City. I truly appreciate all the support so many people in Kansas City and across the country have shown me since I started this campaign. But I can’t work on myself and run a campaign the way I want to at the same time, so I’m choosing to work on my depression.\nI’ll also be taking a step back from day-to-day operations at Let America Vote for the time being, but the organization will continue moving forward. We are doing vital work across the country to stop voter suppression and will keep doing so through November and beyond.\nHaving made the decision not to run for mayor, my next question was whether I would be public about the reason why. I decided to be public for two reasons: First, I think being honest will help me through this. And second, I hope it helps veterans and everyone else across the country working through mental health issues realize that you don’t have to try to solve it on your own. Most people probably didn’t see me as someone that could be depressed and have had PTSD symptoms for over decade, but I am and I have. If you’re struggling with something similar, it’s OK.

        "description": "Any choice made out of a place of desperation is accompanied by enormous sacrifices. Working for Backpage changed everything.\nContent warning: sexual violence\nII started advertising on Backpage in 2015, when I had just been fired from my job after my employer found out I was an addict in recovery. Advertising on Backpage saved my life.\nI started in the sex industry under duress. But I have worked in the industry for ten years now by choice. Anti-trafficking activists will have you believe that the sex industry is black and white but in reality, personal and sexual agency exist on a very, very long spectrum. I am a trafficking survivor and a sex worker — both can and do exist in a single person at the very same time.\nImage for post\nBackpage’s adult section was shut down in late 2016 after pressure from the federal government, which alleged the site was deleting code words for underage prostitution on individual ads that were useful in tracking sex trafficking of minors. Ironically, as the Washington Post pointed out:\n“Experts suggest that allowing sex to be advertised online makes it easier for police to identify these victims — who would otherwise be on the street or on other Web sites that are more difficult to monitor.”\nIn essence, the result of the shut down was displacement of sex workers everywhere, driving any potential sexual exploitation exponentially further underground and making it considerably more difficult to identify. When I began advertising on Backpage in 2015, I had already been in the sex industry for eleven years.\nI started as a teenager in New York City, working for the Latin Kings gang in Washington Heights and the Bronx. Even after I escaped the gang however, my exploitation did not end. Several years later, I was pimped out by my then- fiance, who worked for the Sinaloa Cartel, the most powerful and feared of all the Mexican cartels.\nLiving with my fiance, I remember being raped every day — being strangled with towels and old clothes, being kicked, punched, body slammed, and assaulted with weapons. I’ve experienced a lifetime of violence from men who were supposed to love me — a lifetime of alienation from “legitimate” economies, because I have Bipolar Disorder, because I’m an addict and alcoholic, and because I have complex PTSD, which makes it hard for me to work a job where I have to have a boss telling me what to do.\nI’ve been fired from a job in social work for being an addict in recovery and I’ve been fired from a job in social work for being an “out” sex worker who would not recant her support of the profession.\nWhen Backpage came into my life, I had decided that this time I was going to engage in the sex industry by choice. It was a way for me to re-write my past trauma and reclaim my body for myself. I am not a valued member of American capitalistic society. I am what capitalism might call “useless.” But a “useless” mentally ill person still needs to make money under capitalism somehow.\nAfter placing an ad under the now defunct “escort” section, my phone immediately began ringing off the hook. Every single day I easily got at least a hundred phone calls, which meant I had the power to cherry pick who was worthy of my time—and my beautiful pussy—and who wasn’t.\nImage for post\nI’ve experienced a lifetime of violence from men who were supposed to love me\nImage for post\nSociety throws marginalized folks in the trash then gets angry at us when we do what we got to do to survive. I would love for anyone to tell me where a marginalized person can have more autonomy — physically, fiscally and otherwise — than in the sex industry. Anyone? Anyone? Didn’t think so.\nI loved advertising on BP. Backpage gave me the ability to be contacted by clients and screen them in the ways that felt the most safe to me. Some sex workers I knew took client inquiries exclusively by email and demanded proof of employment and legal identification — demands that are all but impossible if you’re hustling on the street to survive.\nBP was also extremely accessible—even for low income workers such as myself. Advertising prices were on a kind of sliding scale—$12 to see your ad regenerate at the top of the list for three days—that sort of thing. After I left BP, it was free for a while too. But more than anything, BP allowed me to have total control over my employment. Not being told what to do or forced to do anything I wasn’t comfortable with was unprecedented and incredibly liberating considering the history I’d had in the sex industry.\nImage for post\nI am what capitalism might call “useless.”\nImage for post\nThe majority of clients I worked with from BP were—by and large—very kind and respectful. There were of course, a few creeps here and there, but I always managed to leave a trick when my hooker spidey senses told me something was off. Because BP gave me a huge clientele to choose from with minimal risk compared to street work, I didn’t feel as pressured to take every single client that came my way.\nMy sex work ceased to be marked by the sheer desperation to make money. If there’s one thing I know for sure, any choice made out of a place of desperation—a place predicated on the barest bones of survival—is usually accompanied by enormous sacrifices. In terms of my health and safety, Backpage changed everything.\nThe war on BP and online sex work claims its battles are waged in the name of trafficking victims. But arguably, the most common factors contributing to this kind of vulnerability are poverty, displacement, and alienation from resources.\nI would argue that the government is, in actuality, facilitating trafficking by driving it further underground, making it more clandestine, and actively preventing sex workers from freely choosing—for themselves—what is and isn’t safe.\nImage for post\nI will forever have fond memories of my time on Backpage. Together with the recent seizure of other sites used by sex workers, such as Eros, it has been difficult to find a safe entry point back into the industry after taking a break for several years. One night last year—I hadn’t eaten in three days, I was so hungry—I ended up walking the track in desperation.\nOnline, sex workers are given a tremendous platform to express their agency and autonomy—two things that the “anti’s” think we can’t possess. But my life on Backpage represented—for the very first time—a life lead completely on my own terms. This safety and freedom is a true rarity for marginalized folks trying to work within American capitalism; it helped my healing immensely.\nImage for post\nIf there’s one thing I know for sure, any choice made out of a place of desperation is usually accompanied by enormous sacrifices.\nImage for post\nMy answer to the trafficking problem is not simple, but it’s necessary if we want to truly address the systemic destruction of vulnerable populations. We’ve got to decriminalize prostitution, removing the legal penalties; this is not to be confused with removing all government regulations. This decriminalization must, in turn, be combined with an overhaul of state and federal policies aimed at dismantling institutional oppressions such as racism, poverty, sexism, and transphobia.\nI realize these are huge meta-goals, but I believe they can be broken down into several direct, actionable steps.\nAs a start we have to examine American policies effecting access to health care; poor folks cannot feel like our only options are risking our lives on the streets or risking our lives by not taking necessary medical treatments—because we can’t afford them. Under the current administration, food stamps and other public benefit programs are shrinking which means low income folks—particularly people of color, people with disabilities and gender nonconforming people—will have fewer places to turn for financial help.\nYes, it’s exponentially simpler to shut down BP and hope everything goes away. (Or simply watch as the death toll and rates of poverty crimes rise and blame sex work in a kind of twisted feedback loop). But the belief that eliminating BP will in turn eliminate underground economies of their accompanying risks and problems is not only foolish, it’s dangerous.\nIn short, trafficking has no simple solution. As a trafficking survivor, I feel the need to say that again. TRAFFICKING HAS NO SIMPLE SOLUTION. The minute you think it does, you have failed. Politicians—the bulk of which are rich, cisgender white men—have little to no interest in dismantling the systems which keep them in power, which is in fact, the real “solution” to the trafficking issue, by the way.\nWe must stop looking to them for answers when they are deeply and personally invested in a system that keeps people on the margins at risk of being trafficked. The first place we can start in the war on trafficking is to acknowledge this uncomfortable truth. Speak it out loud. Give it life.\nWe can’t change what we aren’t willing to acknowledge.",

        "title": "How Loving-Kindness Meditation Helped Me Overcome PTSD",
        "description": "Had you asked me to tell my life story a few months ago, it would have gone something like this:\nI was the daughter of a mentally ill mother and an absentee father. I was a foster child as a teenager, a runaway by the age of 17, and homeless by the age of 18. I’d seen violence and fought for my survival on more occasions than I’d care to remember.\nMiraculously, at 18 I managed to find a full-time job at a local casino. Prior to that, I’d worked nothing but minimum wage jobs (at a staggering $8.25 an hour), and the jump to $11 an hour was enough to save my life. I went from sleeping in my 1996 Mercury Sable to living in a studio apartment in a quiet suburb of Chicago. I eventually moved to office work as an administrative assistant before working my way up to become a finance manager. I wrote a book, made friends, and lived happily ever after.\nIt was a real-life Cinderella story. Everything that I’d done — and everything that I will do in the future — I did in spite of my circumstances. I was a victim of unfortunate circumstances, but I’d risen above them to overcome the odds.\nBut I wasn’t the only victim.\nThere’s a traditional Buddhist meditation known as metta bhavana, also known as the loving-kindness meditation. The name comes from the Pali language. Metta translates to love or kindness; bhavana translates to development or cultivation. This cultivation of love has no limits or conditions. It doesn’t depend on whether or not someone “deserves” it. And it doesn’t expect anything in return.\nI learned about this kind of meditation during my first round of therapy. At the time, I didn’t think I needed it. I’m fine, I told myself. I may have had a rough start in life, but now I’m a freaking finance manager for crying out loud! I’ve clearly moved on with my life.\nMy friends and my string of failed relationships didn’t agree. Neither did my history of anxiety attacks or my nightmares and subsequent early morning wake-ups. There were times when I’d wake up with nail-shaped scratches in my palm; I’d clenched my fists so hard in my sleep that they had left marks. At the urging of a friend, I went to see a therapist.\nMy therapist’s office was on the other side of town. As I stared at the walls — mostly filled with degrees, awards, and the occasional picture of a kid — I thought of what I knew about therapy. I figured that it would help me gain some perspective on my past and help me learn how to erase it from my mind.\nInstead, the therapist told me that I’d need to confront my past. He talked about hypnosis techniques and meditation. Then he told me about a technique developed from Buddhist tradition that was known as the loving-kindness meditation. There were some parts that I could agree with, such as feeling metta for yourself and for a good friend. But when he started talking about feeling metta for an enemy — which, in this case, he suggested might be my family — I shook my head.\nFor those of us who are still healing from past trauma and hurt, this kind of love goes against every instinct in our body. How can we be kind to people who weren’t kind to us? How can we love someone who may not deserve our forgiveness, let alone our love?\nI was so taken aback that I never went back to that office. Once again, I told myself that I didn’t need it; but if I’m being honest with myself, I think I was just scared.\nOne good thing came out of that meeting: an official diagnosis. I had post-traumatic stress disorder. I wasn’t surprised; having read about it on the internet, I knew I had the symptoms. Still, before that visit to the therapist I had declined to say anything until I’d gotten a professional diagnosis.\nAt the time, I didn’t understand why it was important to forgive anyone. Wasn’t I the victim? Why should I give anymore than I already have?\nWe resist the idea of forgiveness because in forgiving we risk getting hurt again. We’d rather heal ourselves by forgetting instead of forgiving. But if I’m being honest with myself, forgiveness was harder than being hurt. Forgiveness meant accepting that the people who hurt you are only human. It’s easy to justify running away when you’re running from a monster, but what happens when the monster is just like you?\nThere are five stages to the loving-kindness meditation.\nYou start by finding a quiet place and sitting comfortably. You close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, relaxing your muscles and your mind.\nThen, you begin by practicing metta for yourself. You imagine experiencing complete peace and perfect love for yourself. You say a mantra:\nMay I be well. May I be happy.\nMay I be healthy. May I be at peace.\nMay I be free from pain and suffering.\nBask in that feeling of complete love and peace in yourself for a few minutes.\nThen, shift your focus to someone with whom you are close. This person can be a child, a spouse, or a best friend. Direct your love and gratitude to them.\nMay they be well. May they be happy.\nMay they be healthy. May they be at peace.\nMay they be free from pain and suffering.\nRepeat this step, and remember to bask in that feeling.\nThen, when you’re ready, repeat with someone toward whom you feel neutrally.\nThen repeat with someone who you hate.\nIt’s suggested that you hold an image in your mind of the person toward whom you are directing these feelings and envision yourself sending loving-kindness to him or her — even to the person you dislike (in some cases, especially to the person you dislike). While meditation can take as long as the practitioner desires, the recommendation for beginners is to spend three to five minutes per person.\nThe final step is to extend these loving-kindness feelings to all beings across the globe. From here, you can focus on a feeling of connection and compassion.\nWhen you’re ready, open your eyes and reflect.\nHad you asked my mother to tell my story from her perspective, it would have gone something like this:\nShe was a single mother whose daughter had been taken away by the state. She was an immigrant, and everything that she had worked hard for was taken away by a diagnosis from a psychiatrist.\nIt was a story that ended in tragedy. I resisted the idea of forgiveness because it meant no longer accepting that I was a victim. It meant taking responsibility for my part in anything that had ever happened to me.\nI unexpectedly encountered the practice of loving-kindness meditation for a second time at a Buddhist meditation center. I decided, on whim, to attend a meditation class. I heard that the meditations were different every week, but I recognized the pattern as soon as I heard it — and, in a moment of panic, I thought about leaving. I thought that doing the meditation would cripple me. But the opposite happened.\nAfter the first time, I felt free. I was no longer weighed down by my circumstances. I was in control of my own destiny. We don’t realize how heavy our burdens are until they’re lifted.\nI meditate regularly now, but bad days still come. I don’t think there’s any way to keep them from sneaking up every once in a while. But it’s been months since I’ve had an anxiety attack. Sometimes, relief comes in the most unexpected ways.",

        "title": "I Didn’t Know I Had PTSD",
        "description": "“It sounds like you have post-traumatic stress disorder,” my therapist said.\nI was 21 and sitting across from my therapist on the third floor of the university health center, a box of tissues on the coffee table between us and her bulky copy of the DSM-5 spread out on my lap. The book — otherwise known as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders — listed everything that could possibly be wrong with a person, and over the course of my weekly therapy sessions we zeroed in on one of them for me: PTSD.\nI started going to the health center in the fall semester of my junior year, wanting to take advantage of free therapy sessions and figure out why my body had been acting so strangely. Since February, I was having panic attacks nearly every day. My symptoms would strike when I was quietly reading a book in my apartment or riding in a car with friends on the way to a party, or even just walking leisurely to class in the morning. Without warning, my heart would start galloping, a cold chill would run down my body, and I’d have a sudden bout of dizziness or diarrhea. I was afraid to leave the house in case something set it off. I was afraid to stay inside for the same reason. Whenever our doorbell would ring or my roommate would turn on the blender, the symptoms came roaring back. Anything could set me off. I couldn’t figure out why.\nDuring our sessions, my therapist and I had started piecing together some answers. The symptoms started after I flew home from a semester in India, which was cut short due to a medical emergency. One morning about six weeks in, I woke up in my dorm with an agonizing, stabbing pain in my right lower back. The pain was transcendent, a white-hot knife that had jolted me out of sleep and sent me stumbling to the bathroom, retching and crying and trying to pee (without success). With two friends I hailed an auto-rickshaw to the nearest hospital and waited for hours in a crowded triage room to see a doctor, all the while rushing back and forth between the hospital bed and a squat toilet in the waiting room.\nBy the time I saw a doctor, I was throwing up into a kidney dish and shivering with fever. Because I didn’t speak much Hindi, I didn’t understand most of what I was told. Was this life-threatening, I wondered? Maybe some gastrointestinal infection from eating street food? I had no clue. A nurse ferried me around from one room to another for tests, and still clutching my back I hobbled around getting X-rays, ultrasounds, and an unsuccessful catheter placement. In between tests, I tried to call my family back in the United States, but all my calls kept dropping. At one point, while I was laying on a bed, an older nurse wandered over to my bedside and laid her hand gently on my back, quietly praying over me. It was a beautiful gesture, yet at the time it terrified me. Am I going to die or something?\nFinally, a doctor showed up at my bedside with the test results. The X-rays showed that I had something called a urinary tract obstruction — a kidney stone had lodged itself in my urethra, and it didn’t appear to be coming out anytime soon. They would need to admit me to the hospital and do a surgical procedure to break up the stone to allow it to pass. I agreed, got some pain meds, and later that night I had the procedure — my first surgery ever.\nI was discharged the next morning — but almost as soon as I had left the hospital I started feeling the same stabbing pain in my back. The periods of nausea were so strong I couldn’t do anything but lie on my bathroom floor and moan. I went back to the hospital.\n“It’s normal,” the doctor said with a wave of his hand. The stabbing pains were likely “shards” that had broken off the kidney stone during surgery that my body was still trying to pass. The nausea, he said, was a side effect from one of the antibiotics with which they had discharged me. Whatever the cause, I decided I was too nauseous and in pain to keep up with any tasks of daily living — like laundry and going to class. Defeated, I decided to fly back home to recuperate. A few weeks later, I was back in the U.S. My kidney pain was gone, and my panic attacks began.\nI could barely contain my embarrassment. PTSD was what people got when they survived a trauma like war.\nWWhen my therapist informed me that I probably had PTSD from the experience, I felt equal parts relieved and embarrassed. On one hand, the diagnosis made sense. My galloping heartbeat, my crying spells, my nausea and dizziness — all of it surfaced whenever I encountered something that reminded me of India, though I didn’t realize it until I got to therapy. When I had a panic attack reading books in my room, it was because one of the characters was sick and dying in a foreign jail with no one to help him. When I had a panic attack riding in a car on the way to a party, it was because I suddenly had the urge to pee and there were cars honking everywhere — exactly like there had been on the auto-rickshaw ride to the hospital in India. The doorbell- and blender-induced panic attacks were classic hypervigilance.\nOn the other hand, I could barely contain my embarrassment. PTSD was what people got when they survived a trauma like war. I, on the other hand, had had a kidney stone. It was a fraction of the size of a pencil eraser and probably caused, the doctors said, from drinking oxalate-rich chai every single morning. There was no way I could claim that diagnosis, I thought, as though getting a kidney stone was in any way similar to other, worse traumas.\n“I mean, maybe,” I told her, reaching for the box of tissues. I felt my face flush. “It could be something else, though.”\nIt’s almost funny to me now that I was crying and hyperventilating every time I felt a strong urge to pee yet I still couldn’t accept that my hysterical panic could actually be due to a traumatic, pee-related experience. But as it turns out, my reaction is common. “For a lot of people, PTSD can be a struggle to recognize and come to terms with,” says Ryan Herringa, director of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health.\n“The core aspect of PTSD is avoidance, and people suffering from PTSD will go to any extent to ignore triggers or to get out of a triggering situation,” Herringa says. Rather than digging into the symptoms to find the root cause, people with PTSD often spend much of their time trying to escape or avoid them. Reminders of past trauma can be so painful, he says, that “the patient doesn’t want to admit to even having triggers in some cases, for fear of having to talk about it more.”\nLike me, people with PTSD might shut down, deflect with humor (my specialty), dismiss their symptoms, or even halt treatment altogether when asked to confront their triggers. “The illness itself is what makes it so challenging to diagnose and to treat,” says Herringa.\nSometimes, as in my case, people with PTSD may not even realize they have triggers at all, or even that their bizarre cluster of symptoms is actually a response to trauma. This is due to the fact that the brain can quickly interpret danger and send the rest of the body roaring into an acute stress response without the conscious mind understanding why. Someone who’s escaped a deadly house fire and has developed PTSD, for example, might subconsciously associate certain sensory cues with extreme danger, such as the smell of smoke or a song that was playing on the radio right before the fire broke out. The next time a person smells smoke or hears that song — even if they don’t realize it — their brain will leap into action, sending signals to the sympathetic nervous system that cause the heart to race, breathing to become shallow, pupils to dilate, and skin to break out in a cold sweat. Known as the “fight or flight” response, this can happen instantaneously and on such a subconscious level that people may take years (or extensive therapy) to figure out why.\nEven when triggers are easily recognizable, a PTSD diagnosis might be hard for people to embrace. Decades ago, PTSD was known as “shell shock,” a phrase that medical officer Charles Myers coined when treating soldiers during World War I. Shell shock — thought to be caused by exploding artillery — was a phrase used by physicians at the time to describe a cluster of symptoms observed in soldiers returning from combat, including nightmares, flashbacks, crying spells, dizziness, tremors, nausea, and more. Eventually, this diagnosis was included in the DSM as post-traumatic stress disorder, and doctors now understand that it can affect civilians as well, such as people who survive sexual violence or domestic abuse, or even people who have witnessed a shocking or life-threatening event. But because the disorder was first recognized in soldiers, there remains a strong cultural connotation with PTSD and veterans — and as such, many people with PTSD can feel unworthy of the diagnosis. A large part of his job, Herringa says, is helping people understand that PTSD can affect anybody, and that their diagnosis is valid. “The message I often give to families is that you may not have been through combat or war, but you’ve been through your own personal war zone — maybe in your neighborhood or in your bedroom — and it has the same effects,” he says.\nIronically, many of the veterans that Herringa treats often feel unworthy of the diagnosis too. “Even with combat veterans, they’re often comparing traumas and wounds,” Herringa says. “They’ll say, ‘my infantry colleague lost his arm and his leg, and I was only mildly injured — I didn’t have it as bad as he did.’”\nAs for the guilt and shame? “I think a lot of this comes back to these core Western ideas that somehow if we just have enough mental fortitude, we should be able to get through anything — which is really bizarre,” Herringa says. “There’s a lot of guilt and shame that comes up when we’re talking about our own traumas because there’s this cultural sense that we should just be able to get over it, and we should get over it on our own,” he says. “It’s not true, but it’s the myth that persists.”\nAfter my therapist floated the idea of PTSD, she referred me to a psychiatrist, who put me on Zoloft. Within a few months, the panic attacks lessened and then went away completely — but, like a lot of other people, the guilt and embarrassment and shame around the diagnosis lived on. When people asked me about my semester in India, I shrugged it off, saying I had a nice time — which was true, aside from the hospital trip. I told almost no one that I had developed PTSD and even when I did, I followed up my admission by admitting it was my own stupid fault: I had drunk too much chai or hadn’t drunk enough water, causing the kidney stone to form. I had a fever and couldn’t stop vomiting and needed emergency surgery, sure — but I probably wasn’t in any real danger. The surgery was practically outpatient, for crying out loud. The next time I had a kidney stone, I’d know what was happening, and I wouldn’t be so scared next time. I wouldn’t think, foolishly, that I was dying.\nOOne night a few years later I was watching a horror movie called It Follows with my husband and a few of our friends. In the movie, a girl named Jay is stalked and terrorized by a demon that takes the form of different people. The demon follows her continuously throughout the movie — and so even in scenes where she’s successfully escaped its clutches, it’s just a matter of time before the demon, always slowly moving toward her, is going to catch up. When she’s lounging on the beach or in the middle of a college class, she’s constantly looking, scanning, searching for the demon that will appear out of nowhere and upend her life.\nI nearly jumped off the couch with excitement. “That’s what it felt like!” I said. “That’s exactly how it felt when I came home from India! That’s how PTSD feels!” Like Jay’s demon, my panic attacks could strike at any time, from anywhere, and flatten me. My life orbited around the trauma, even after I thought I had finished processing it, even when I was sure I should have just moved on from it already. The movie ends with Jay slaying the demon — but still glancing behind her as she walks, just in case.\nSometimes I still feel guilty when I think about getting PTSD, even though what triggered me a decade ago no longer bothers me now. My shame still tells me that it wasn’t such a big deal. But I now understand how PTSD functions, and no matter my experience, no matter how guilty I still feel, the experience still left me traumatized — so much so that I could watch a movie about a girl being stalked by a demon and feel like I was watching a biopic based on my life. It’s taken me years to realize, but there’s no getting around it: I had post-traumatic stress disorder — and my diagnosis is valid.",

I told almost no one that I had developed PTSD and even when I did, I followed up my admission by admitting it was my own stupid fault: I had drunk too much chai or hadn’t drunk enough water, causing the kidney stone to form. Reminders of past trauma can be so painful, he says, that “the patient doesn’t want to admit to even having triggers in some cases, for fear of having to talk about it more.”\nLike me, people with PTSD might shut down, deflect with humor (my specialty), dismiss their symptoms, or even halt treatment altogether when asked to confront their triggers. Rather than digging into the symptoms to find the root cause, people with PTSD often spend much of their time trying to escape or avoid them. My life orbited around the trauma, even after I thought I had finished processing it, even when I was sure I should have just moved on from it already. The next time a person smells smoke or hears that song — even if they don’t realize it — their brain will leap into action, sending signals to the sympathetic nervous system that cause the heart to race, breathing to become shallow, pupils to dilate, and skin to break out in a cold sweat.",

        "title": "What to Do When the News Cycle Triggers Your PTSD",
        "description": "et me get this part out of the way: When I was 17, a relative sexually assaulted me, creating a deep chasm in my family that still exists 13 years later and leaving me with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I won’t go into detail here, partly because I’m tired of spilling my guts on the internet and partly because I don’t want to cause my parents more pain.\nBut it goes without saying that the news cycle of late, sparked by allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, has been difficult at best and unbearable at worst. Watching Dr. Christine Blasey Ford recount an assault so similar to my own (in front of a panel of hostile men, no less) was painful. Realizing how many people don’t believe survivors was even more painful. Over the past few weeks, and especially the past several days, I’ve felt stuck in a cycle of rage, hopelessness, and paralyzing anxiety — and thanks to the PTSD, which I was finally diagnosed with five years ago, my fight-or-flight response is in such overdrive that even leaving the house feels exhausting.\nPost-traumatic stress — which can include agitation, hypervigilance, insomnia, social isolation, flashbacks, detachment or lack of interest, and increased anxiety — is a common response to sexual assault. In one study, 94 percent of female assault victims surveyed experienced PTSD symptoms two weeks after their assault; according to the National Center for PTSD, 30 percent report still having symptoms nine months later.\nThose symptoms can last for years, lying dormant for lengths of time, only to emerge during especially triggering news events and national conversations. “[PTSD symptoms] can last indefinitely in some cases,” says David Woo, a psychiatrist at Madison Avenue TMS and Psychiatry. “PTSD can flare up years later and feel fresh as though [the event] happened just yesterday.”\nThousands of sexual assault survivors have revealed their traumas online under the #StopKavanaugh and #WhyIDidntReport movements. Assault survivors are currently walking a tightrope: We want to be informed and engaged citizens, but we also want to protect our mental well-being. And right now, doing both feels impossible — I’d love to turn off the TV and delete my social media accounts, but as a journalist and simply as a human, I know I need to understand what’s going on in the world.\nSo what can you to do when you can’t escape from the news cycle that triggers your PTSD? I talked to mental health experts to find out.\nSeparate Real Life from Online Life\nYou don’t need to totally disconnect, but try to be more intentional about when you consume news. I get it: We live in a hyperfast, hyperconnected time, and scrolling through Twitter can feel as mindless as breathing. But the more you absorb, the more overwhelming it feels, especially when reading about sexual assault can make you feel like you’re reliving your own trauma. To combat this, Nicole Cooper, a licensed clinical psychologist at Union Square Practice and assistant professor in the psychiatry department at the NYU School of Medicine, recommends that you “set personal boundaries to protect yourself.”\n“Tell friends and co-workers that you don’t want to talk about it,” Cooper says. “Share that you’re taking a break, or exit a conversation that’s making you uncomfortable. Designate a trusted friend to inform you of any news that’s relevant so you can unplug.” She also suggests listening to “a meditation or inspiring or educational podcast” before bed and when you wake up, instead of news or social media.\nI’ve tried to follow this advice, scheduling a strict “no news” hour before sleep and deleting the Twitter app to prevent myself from robotically scrolling in bed. And while I used to keep TV news on all day while I worked from home, I’m more thoughtful about it now, tuning in only when I need to. I also leave my phone at home when I run errands or walk my dogs. Creating some enforced physical separation from your news feed, even in small increments, can feel cathartic.\nDo Something for Yourself\n“Self-care” is a buzzword that gets thrown around a lot, but all it means is deliberately setting time aside to do something for yourself, be it a walk, a bath, a home-cooked meal, or a home improvement project. (I recommend scheduling your self-care time to overlap with your no-screen time.) Woo says “mindfulness exercises like yoga, meditative breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation” are helpful. Cooper suggests doing something to give back, like volunteering at a local shelter or being a nonjudgmental listener for a friend. (She also warns against overusing substances — a glass of wine might be part of your self-care regimen, but be mindful of how much you’re consuming.)\nThe most effective activity will vary from person to person, but the key is to do whatever makes you feel safe and in control. “Recognize that the events in the media are reminders of your own traumatic event but that you are safe in the here and now,” Cooper says. “It’s not actually happening to you — what happened to you is in the past.”\nLean on Your Support Network\n“By far, the most valuable resource is other safe people,” says Matt Lundquist, LCSW, a psychotherapist at Tribeca Therapy. “To share these experiences with friends and partners is vital in changing how they sit with you emotionally.” It took me years to tell anyone outside of my immediate family about my assault, so the shame I felt after it happened compounded into an isolating, burdensome silence.\nIt wasn’t until I opened up to my partner, my friends, and an online community of other assault survivors that the shame started to dissipate. “There is power in recognizing that it is an experience shared by other people,” Lundquist says. If the people close to you don’t feel safe to share with, the confidential National Sexual Assault Hotline is open 24 hours a day at 1-800-656-4673, and providers can connect you with local support. RAINN also has an online chat option, as well as a comprehensive list of other resources. Even if you aren’t ready to share publicly (you might never be, and that’s okay), try exploring the #WhyIDidntReport hashtag.\nGet Professional Help\nIf the news cycle is making you feel out of control, isolated, or like you can’t function, or if you’re self-medicating with drugs or alcohol, it’s time for professional help. The good news is that “[mental health care] is more accessible now than ever before,” Cooper says. “Look for low-cost programs at major hospitals and universities in your area. Check if you qualify for Medicaid or if your insurance has mental health benefits. Mental health [service] at hospitals and clinics has improved greatly.” You can correspond with a therapist via text with apps like Talkspace. It can be hard to seek help when you’re barely functioning, but that’s where your support network comes in: Ask a friend or family member if they’ll help research your options or go with you to the appointment.\nMost important, know that you can and will feel better, even if everything around you suggests otherwise. “Many who continue to struggle with the emotional consequences of an assault have a sense of pessimism or hopelessness, the idea that they might simply have to live with the effects of trauma,” Lundquist says. “Not so. There is good help out there. If you’ve tried to get help and it didn’t work, find better help. See 10 therapists until you find the one you really believe is right, and then stick it out.”",

        "title": "I have Complex PTSD. It works like this.",
        "description": "December 7, 1990: My father gets down on his knees and begs the cops to shoot him. It happens under Christmas lights. I am blamed for it.\nI will have my first suicidal thought less than a year later. I will be able to count on one hand the number of nights I truly felt safe after that.\nPart of me died that day. Other parts died in the months that followed. Still other parts have been trying for 25 years to follow them to the grave. For part of me, there will never be a tomorrow. There will only be then.\nIt works like this: Your brain rewrites memories to make sense of the emotional reality you endured. It deletes the parts where you acted bravely because it does not fit with the fear you felt, and I mean that exactly: like cutting out the middle of a film strip, it leaves you with the first and last parts. You hear \"911, what is your emergency\" and think \"holy shit, I am calling the cops on my Pop\" and the next thing is that you’re hanging up the phone. Then he’s there and he picks you up by your shirt collar with both hands, shoves you against the wall, and blows hot, stinking rage in your face, and for 23 years you cannot for the life of you figure out who called the cops. Probably the neighbors. You then assume that they are the ones who got in touch with your mom and told her to come. Or maybe it was Grandma. Or was it Cathy. It was definitely someone. You do not know yet that it was you.\nYour brain has also protected you from remembering the worst parts of it. It's not until you're 29 that the begging for suicide part comes back after your mom casually mentions it like you hadn't forgotten and it comes rushing back and slams into you so hard that you drop out of a semester of grad school. Your classmates are trying to figure out why you're leaving the group project you're working on. They ask can't we just fix this? No, we can't fix this. You do not know yet that this was a flashback.\nAnd it's not fixed. You just have that part now, probably sooner than you should have had it. Life appears to go on and little things still never fit into place. You feel like your whole life is a series of episodes with no connecting narrative. It's a story without sense. I mean, it makes sense in a way because you can trace your history through time, this was sixth grade and that was seventh grade, but it still feels off. The bell sounds hollow. Of course, everyone else is happy to, or even eager to, write this off as the usual forgetting that comes with time or to philosophize about existential angst and the human condition or to tell you that your unease indicates a need for The Savior. But you never actually forget, not really, and it shows in how when you're touched in your sleep you immediately pop up and ask what's wrong and in how you react when someone dumps you and in how you have to go outside and smoke three cigarettes during that scene in Friday Night Lights where the dad kicks out the car windows. It's even in the goddamned cigarettes themselves and you fucking hate that so much and can't stop. And it's especially in the rage you feel when someone acts like you don't know what your clients have lived through and mistakes you for someone more like themselves.\nHow else do you explain it except that you’re broken? You’re not a fucking idiot, that you’re sure of. You can see the evidence of that. You can also see that other people seem to get through school, life, work, and relationships without the same struggle you go through. The deep, deep shame you carry about your deep, deep shame is that you know that you’re not living up to your potential. You were the one who was supposed to \"make it,\" and here you are constantly wondering how long you’ll be able to hold out before you one day get too tired and too exhausted and just end it all. You do not know yet that this is C-PTSD.\nWhat you don't know yet is that the whole world, in collusion with your own brain, has conspired to gaslight you.\nIt was your fault, they say, imply, nod, glance, intone, hit, neglect, and scream.\nIt was my fault, you say, imply, nod, glance, intone, hit, neglect, and scream.\nAfter a while they don't need to actively abuse you and they don't need to beat you down to cover up their own shame at what they did. They've gotten you to do the work for them. And holy fucking moses are you good at it. You're like the best at it after a while.\nWhat you don't know yet is that it wasn't your fault.\nAnd when the time is right and enough bad things happen and you're capable of dealing with more of it, it starts coming up again.\nHe's dead now and you can openly mourn the loss of your entire childhood.\nYou look in the mirror and wonder if you ever make his faces when you're angry. You are now the age that he was when things started getting bad. You pull down your cheeks and poke at the wrinkles that make you feel older than you feel. You wonder if you'll not be afraid to have children in time to have them. You wonder how anyone could bear to stick around with someone who has such a corrosive, and heretofore largely secret, history of chronic suicidal ideation.\nYou are making what they call progress. That sense of disconnection is disappearing as you re-experience everything that happened in between and you recover your memories. It's excruciating and holy fuck terrifying and you get attacked by so much shame and hopelessness and you often don't think you'll get through it without killing yourself. But you repeat what you know and it's that it's too early for all that. Not at 35. You're still a baby even though you're not ready to admit that maybe he was too. All you have to do is keep doing exactly what you're doing and not die. That's it. You're being real with your people. You know you can trust them even if you have a hard time with it and fear on a panic level that someone will jump in and try to fix it for you or even inadvertently condescend to you and only see your struggle. You want to bellow in advance that if you weren't one of the strongest motherfuckers around that you'd be dead already and you hope that your natural ferocity says it for you that it's not advised to fuck around with you like that, without you having to say it. But you know they know that. I mean fuck 'em if they don't but you know they do. You're letting them know you. It's cool. You're letting new acquaintances know this along with close friends, my man. This is how we fight shame. They say it helps. Part of you believes them. And maybe it's exactly as it should be that you still tremble every time you click post. You can hear drum beats in the distance. Something's out there. But you wonder if \"progress\" means that you will ever really be good in your own skin and will ever really know that it wasn't your fault. You wonder if the rest of you will ever age past December 7, 1990.\nYou wonder if you'll ever again be able to sleep without fear.\nIt works like this.\n",

        "description": "Myth 1: You can have one alcoholic drink an hour and still drive home.\n\nYou've probably heard the theory that our bodies naturally process a drink an hour. But actually, says Warren, it's more like two hours. \"The average rate of alcohol metabolism is 100 milligrams of alcohol per kilogram of bodyweight per hour,\"\n\nMyth 2: You can sober up quickly if you have to.\n\nNothing speeds up the process, not a hot cup of coffee nor a cold shower. Caffeine can actually do more harm than good, says Warren. \"Caffeine is a stimulant, and because of that, a person's going to be more awake but just as much impaired.\n\nMyth 3: \"Break the seal\" and you'll spend all night in line for the bathroom.\n\nDrinking alcohol will send you to the bathroom more frequently than if you abstained. Booze suppresses the hormone vasopressin, which means more liquid than usual is redirected to the bladder.\n\nMyth 4: Beer before liquor, never been sicker.\n\nIn reality, you're probably finding yourself in the throes of a wicked hangover because of the total amount of alcohol you consumed, not the order in which you consumed it, the New York Times reported.\n\nMyth 5: Drinking beer gives you a beer belly.\n\nIt certainly can -- but so can anything you consume in excess. That stereotypical beer-drinker's gut is a sign you're overdoing it on something, but not necessarily beer.\n\nMyth 6: A nightcap will help you sleep.\n\nA drink before bedtime can make it easier to fall asleep, but booze-fueled snoozing quickly becomes disrupted.\n\nMyth 7: Those hangover prevention \"shots\" are the answer.\n\nThere's no scientific evidence to support any of the claims made on those products marketed as the cure to all hangovers, no matter how many vitamins they're packed with\n\nMyth 8: A bacon, egg and cheese the morning after will get you back to normal.\n\nIf you eat before you drink or while you drink, the effect of the food is to decrease the rate of absorption of alcohol into the body and ... you will not get as high of a blood alcohol concentration\n\nMyth 9: Passing out from drinking isn't that big of a deal.\n\nAlcohol poisoning is drinking a sufficient amount of alcohol to suppress the central nervous system so that an individual stops required bodily functions\n\nsource:",

        "description": "1. Your Brain\n\nAlcohol impairs brain areas such as the cerebellum—the control site for your balance and coordination—and your cerebral cortex, which is responsible for thinking, memory, and learning, says Kimberly S. Walitzer, Ph.D., deputy director of the University at Buffalo’s Research Institute on Addictions.\n\nPlus, University of Michigan researchers found the amygdala—an area of the brain involved in fear and anger—showed less of a reaction to threatening faces after a single drink, potentially explaining why you’re prone to risky behavior (like fighting a bouncer) under the influence.\n\n2. Your Skin\n\nSure, beer goggles may make other people appear hotter—but booze doesn’t do your own mug many favors. This gives you bloodshot eyes and worsens a ruddy-skinned condition called rosacea, says dermatologist David E. Bank, M.D., of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. Your heart pumps more fluid into surrounding tissues to balance out those alcohol-widened arteries and veins, leaving you with a bloated, puffy face.\n\n3. Your Muscles\n\nAlcohol tinkers with your hormonal and inflammatory responses to exercise, making it more difficult for your body to repair damaged proteins and build new ones (essential steps in getting ripped), according to a recent review in the journal Sports Medicine.\n\nSo take the time to get some protein, carbohydrates, and non-boozy fluids into your system post-workout before cracking open your first cold one.\n\n4. Your Heart\n\nModerate drinking might protect your ticker due to the blood vessel-relaxing polyphenols that alcohol contains or by raising your levels of HDL, (“good” cholesterol), says researcher Kirsten Mehlig, Ph.D., of the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.\n\nBut her recent study in the journal Alcohol suggests these effects may only benefit the 15 percent of the population with a certain genetic profile affecting HDL levels. It’s too soon to recommend genetic testing to guide your alcohol consumption, she points out.\n\nThis type of irregular heartbeat approximately quadruples your risk of having a stroke and triples your risk of heart failure.\n\n5. Your Stomach\n\nJust one night of bingeing—that’s five drinks or more for guys in about 2 hours—increases what’s called your gut permeability, according to University of Massachusetts Medical School researchers. Harmful toxins and bacteria leak from your digestive system into your bloodstream, prompting a dangerous immune-system response that can eventually lead to liver disease and other health problems. At lower doses, alcohol irritates your stomach, increases acidity, and relaxes the muscle at the end of your esophagus, causing heartburn.\n\n6. Your Penis\n\nHaving as few as five drinks a week decreases your sperm count and percentage of healthy swimmers, perhaps by affecting levels of sex hormones like testosterone. And while you may find a glass of vino sets the mood, anything more than that could wreck your performance in the bedroom. Almost three-quarters of men with alcohol dependence have at least one sexual health issue, such as low desire, erectile dysfunction, or premature ejaculation, say Indian researchers.",

        "title": "Why people consume alcohol and stick to it",
        "description": "Alcohol doesn't taste good and we're constantly trying to mask it's disgusting flavor through fruity punches, sodas, lemon and limes. It can become toxic to our livers, in our blood stream, and kill brain cells. It's actually a depressant so why do people drink when they're sad only to become more sad?\n\nI get that every now and then it's funny to watch people mess up and do silly stuff but all the time? Doesn't it get boring after a while? I don't see the fun in it. I don't find it funny when people are acting stupid from the effects of alcohol. It's actually more annoying to me than humorous. Most people's idea of having fun is getting shit-faced on a Saturday night rather than just chilling with friends.\n\nDo you drink alcohol? Why/why not? Why do many people think it's \"cool\" to drink? And people are so easily impressed when someone can take a shot without a chaser... big deal.\n\nThere are reasons behind the liking and disliking anything. Same is the case with alcohol. What we see we get inspired of that and like to do that either it is good or bad. Specially the youth are today more inspired by these all habits, and they don’t care about the taste. Just to follow the trend they can do anything without thinking about their health hazards. Its well known that “excess of anything is harmful” , if we try alcohol for once or twice, or we take it occasionally then it is not bad but if we start liking it and taking it n regular basis then it is harmful for us.\n\nA person might believe that he is drinking for one reason but in reality he would be doing it for complete different reason that he is not aware of. There are some unconscious reason that motivate people to drink..\n\nWhy do people drink alcohol?\n\n1)Mood Regulation: For the first instance mood regulation might not sound like a bad idea. After all if someone can drink to improve his mood then why not do it? In fact if you need mood regulation then there must be something completely wrong with your mood. In such a case you are using alcohol to escape from the state you barley tolerate to a state that makes you feel better. Some people drink to have more courage to approach others, do you know what does this really mean? It means that they are cowards who just need anything to help them become brave. The problem in such a case is not with alcohol itself but its with the horrible state those people are in when they are sober.\n\n2) To let others see them differently: The tomboy who hates the fact that men are more likely to take risks might start drinking just to prove to the world that he can be as careless as a man. The guy who desperately wants to appeal to women might start drinking to seem more like a bad boy (the typical type of man who attracts women). This guy isn't aware of the fact that Alcohol reduces testosterone production and makes him more of a feminine man than a bad boy. In other words, many people drink to create a new identity and to force others to see them in a new way.\n\n3) To prove something & protect their beliefs: Some people drink to prove something to themselves or to the world. Some people might want to appear happier in the presence of others, Some might want to appear more social while a third group might want to prove that alcohol is actually a good thing. An atheist might start drinking just to prove to the world that drinking is a good thing or in other words, he just wants to prove that religions are wrong. Many people get involved in bad habits just to prove something to themselves or to others while believing that they are doing them for completely different reasons.\n\nThere are some more common reasons like:-\n\nStress:- For some people, drinking alcohol is a way of relieving stress. The alcohol numbs them to the various stressors in their life, such as work, school, relationships, money, etc. The irony is that when people drink too often to cope with their stress, they usually make the problems they’re stressed out about even worse, and they can develop worse problems, like alcoholism.\n\nPeer Pressure:-Many people drink just because the people around them are drinking, and they might feel an indirect peer pressure to drink so they aren’t the odd one out. Someone might feel obligated to drink when the rest of their co-workers are enjoying happy hour, for example. Direct peer pressure is even stronger, and it’s when people are actively encouraging someone to drink. It can be very hard to say no to a drink when someone is pushing it in your face, and it’s even harder for youth who are being ridiculed for not drinking.\n\nFun:-People generally tend to drink alcohol in order to have fun. Being drunk makes them feel happy and spirited, and drinking alcohol with friends can be a fun experience. If people are nervous in social situations, drinking helps them let loose and have more fun. People drink to have fun at parties, nightclubs, barbeques, and more, because they think alcohol enhances their experience.\n\nThe truth is, there are plenty of ways to have fun in recovery.\n\nInhibitions:-Being under the influence of alcohol causes you to lose your inhibitions. It gives people a sense of bravery and being carefree, which allows them to do things safe or unsafe that they wouldn’t do while sober. If people are nervous or scared about doing something, they might drink alcohol to help them shed the inhibitions that are standing in their way.\n\nCuriosity:-The reason of curiosity generally applies to a younger crowd. Kids, teens, and college students who’ve never drank before might drink alcohol because they’re curious about what it tastes like, or they’re curious about what it feels like to be drunk. They begin to drink alcohol in a purely experimental way, just because they want to experience drinking firsthand. However, there are plenty of example of young people getting sober, and increasing their quality of life.\n\nPreference:-Some people drink alcohol simply because they enjoy the taste. When they are thirsty and want to enjoy a beverage, in some situations they prefer to drink alcohol, such as a glass of wine or a beer, over other drinks, such as soda, iced tea, or water.\n\nAccessibility:-Another reason people drink alcohol is just because it’s available. They might enjoy alcohol for any of the other reasons, but they wouldn’t seek it out. They choose to drink only because the alcohol is already there and it’s easy to - “because they can.”\n\n",

        "description": "Every human experience is backed by a chemical basis. People try to put in chemicals either in the form of drugs or drink or whichever way, to manipulate their chemistry into a pleasant experience. If all you are seeking is a little bit of pleasure, I am not against it. But if you are a pleasure seeker, wouldn’t you be interested if you were given an opportunity to have a much bigger pleasure? If you could learn to be drunk all the time and fully alert, wouldn’t you be interested?\n\n\nI don’t think there is anything wrong with alcohol, I am ignoring it because it doesn’t have enough kick in it. I am constantly drunk on something else – simply drunk on life. I can get intoxicated on just my inhalation and exhalation. People have fallen for alcohol because that is the biggest thing that they have seen. I am offering them a different drink, a drink which is much more intoxicating than alcohol. Most people who have tasted this with me have given up alcohol, not because they think it is bad, but because they think it is kindergarten stuff. They have grown beyond it.\n\nThe question is not about wrong or right. This is not a moral standpoint. It is just that it is very limited. You drink a little bit tonight and tomorrow morning you get a big hangover. But I can be drunk twenty-four hours of the day – no hangover, it doesn’t cost anything, and it’s good for health! Isn’t this a better way to drink? We look at alcohol, drugs and all these things as kindergarten stuff because we can get intoxicated a thousand times over just with our aliveness. Why simply wine? You can get drunk with the di-vine.\n\nWhen I say “Inner Engineering”, I am talking about a technology where you can create a chemistry of ecstasy all the time, consciously. Right now it is happening accidentally, triggered by somebody. Whatever you can do unconsciously – by looking at the sunset, or by looking at your loved one – you can also do consciously. That is the basis of Inner Engineering.\n\nWithin you, you have experienced peace and turmoil, joy and misery, ecstasy and agony. So you are capable of all these things. But right now you are conducting this whole experience and chemistry unconsciously. You can also conduct it consciously. That is the whole effort of all spiritual processes – to see that you create your life consciously instead of blundering through it by creating it unconsciously.\n\n",

        "description": "See, you must drink something not according to your wish but according to your body properties. You must drink something that goes well with your body. You must drink something that behaves well within your system. Not that which spoils, not that which damages & not that which troubles you!! If you really pay a little attention to your own body or study a little bit of medical science or at least know the ancient culture (original not distorted), you will come to know that alcohol is in no way good for your body. It is not that if you drink it, you will die there and then. It is just like, in a river, if you swim with the flow of the river (in the direction of the water flow), you can swim effortlessly and there is a chance of swimming maximum distance with so much of ease and Joy! But if you swim against the flow of water, it becomes difficult to swim and you may not sustain much longer! Likewise, if you go with the flow of your body properties and drink only that which integrates with your body easily, you may exponentially reduce your health troubles and your Life journey becomes so much ease and Joyful!\n\nIn addition to damaging different body parts, alcohol will also affect the mind a lot! It stimulates the nerve system, providing a temporary virtual pleasure and relaxation. For this pleasure, most of the humans are getting addicted to alcohol. I am asking why are you not having pleasant Life normally? Why can’t you live your Life very Joyfully that no such external aid is needed to give you temporary pleasure? Alcohol also makes mind dumb and loose. This is why drunken people talk so much loosely and then comes most of their hidden words out! I am asking why are you living so much tightened Life everyday? Why did you make your Life miserable? You think alcohol is going to release you from your pains? Ha ha…No it is not, it is going to make the things even worse! You are going to loose your relationships, time and money. You will even loose your standards in the society which may ultimately lead you to criminalize yourself. It will also reduce the person’s sensitivity and perception towards the Life. People who are drinking alcohol and getting temporary pleasure think like they are having so much of freedom. But the fact is, they are actually becoming slaves and living a limited Life. Freedom is being free from everything not limiting yourself to only certain things!",

        "description": "Certainly there are those people who drink purely for the feeling of intoxication. Those people tend to drink whatever is cheapest, often vodka, and often mixed with other things to hide the taste of alcohol and ice to dull their taste buds.\n\nThere are also people who drink purely for the taste of the beverages. They won’t even swallow, they taste the drink and then spit it out, like wine judges at a competition.\n\nThere’s also a lot of people who enjoy both, together, with more emphasis on one or the other based on their mood, social context, and overall preferences. At times they may drink just a little bit, over a long period of time, purely for the taste, and not even feel the effects. Other times they might drink quite a bit for the express purpose of getting drunk, but enjoy the taste as they drink it, for at least as long as they are sober enough to pay attention to their senses.\n\nI would describe myself as the third type. I’ve certainly nursed a glass of fine Scotch for an entire evening, and probably a decent bit of the alcohol in it evaporated by the end, and I drank it all so slowly that my body metabolized it faster than I was imbibing. Not even a buzz, but I enjoy the experience immensely. I’ve also, at times, felt a desire to get to a certain level of intoxication, and I was less particular about what I was drinking after the first or second glass.\n\nOne time I even volunteered to help the police trainees at the local community college practice their sobriety tests, which involved a somewhat scientific administration of alcohol for participants to reach specific BAC percentages and then perform various tasks and take a breathalyzer over and over again so the future patrolmen could identify drunk drivers (we of course had to have transportation home afterwards already arranged). It was for a good cause, but the alcohol they gave us was far from top shelf and taste was not a consideration in the least.\n\nThe world of alcohol is about as diverse as the world of food. There’s an infinite selection of flavors, aromas, and other characteristics, and there are more of these present in a single glass of the right alcohol than there is in many dishes of food. Of course, pairing food and drink is an art in itself, and a nice glass of wine or beer can enhance a meal in ways that you can’t even imagine if you haven’t experienced it for yourself. Likewise, the right food can bring out flavors in a complex alcoholic beverage in unexpected and delightful ways as well. Food and drink developed side-by-side all through human history, and the creators of each were always trying to make them better together. Some of the people at a fine restaurant probably are looking to get at least a buzz when they order some wine, but a lot of them are really just trying to enhance the flavors of their meal.",

        "description": "If you are currently experiencing depression, NO, without any hesitation NO!\n\nThough isolation feeds depression and depression tends to cause isolation, ‘social media’ is not your friend. I can almost guarantee that opening up on social media will cause more harm than good. First remember most people post their positive moments, so just viewing social media can make someone with depression feel worse. For example if you have 500ish FB ‘friends’ (depending on age the majority are probably people you have not seen for years, an acquaintance, current or former classmates from high school, grad school, co-workers etc) and if each ‘friend’ were to post the ONLY incredible positive thing that happened over the course of a year, it will appear as if EVERYONE is happy, and amazing and successful- everyone but you.\n\nBut why shouldn’t YOU post about your depression on social media? Wouldn’t they want to know? Don’t they care? Here are some important things to consider:\n\nMost people are not equipped to help you like you think they can. If they have not experienced it themselves or are not a professional, they may avoid responding- which will probably make you feel worse. At best you will get an inspirational quote or some positive message ‘hang in there’, ‘thinking about you’ which won’t help with your depression and may cause you to feel misunderstood or frustrated.\n\nPeople tend to avoid what they don’t understand or fear and you may find yourself more isolated.\n\nPeople can be incredibly cruel, especially if they are also hurting, and you are exposing something very personal to a lot of strangers.\n\nInformation can be shared, screenshot, copied so if you post something on social media assume you are posting to the world (to include your worst ‘enemy’).\n\nOnce you share that information with someone personally or on social media you can’t ‘un-share’ it or take it back.\n\nAs ‘open’ as people like to think they are there is a stigma against mental illness that is very real. Potential employers look at social media. Someone could overreact and use a red flag law to take away an inalienable right. When dating people often scroll through someone’s social media.\n\nSince you are asking the question I am guessing that you are hurting and feel the need to talk to someone. I applaud your courage for asking the question and acknowledging you might need help. Social media is just NOT the place.\n\nSo where does that leave you? If you have a family member or a close friend that is emotionally available and that you trust TALK with them, preferably in person. If in person is not an option than a discussion by phone may be a place to start. Just remember, a lot of communication is unspoken and that can be lost during a phone call, so perhaps Skype or Video chat. Also remember this is not a conversation to drop on somebody you have not connected with in a long time. If you are reaching out to someone from your past, give them a heads up that it is something serious and schedule a time to talk (not in between events, dinner, during a commute etc).\n\nThe best option is to seek out a professional, if at all possible. Remember like all professionals there are good ones and bad ones.\n\nIf it is bad enough there are hotlines where you can speak to someone anonymously and they should be able to connect you to local resources, regardless of age or income.\n\nIt is important to keep people in your life during good times and bad. However social media is not a safe place to share personal information, especially things like mental health.",

I am on meds but honestly, I don’t know if they’re helping.\n\nI’d be driving to work in the morning and suddenly burst into tears, for no reason, because that’s what depression looks like.\n\nI feel lonely all the time, even if I’m alone or surrounded by people, and I don’t see it changinf any time soon.\n\nThere are days when I’m just too exhausted to even take a shower, and this comes from someone who’s used to having two showers a day. I’ve gone days without a shower.\n\nBeing married to some who doesn’t seem to understand depression doesn’t really make it easy, you know. You keep wondering if you’re worth it.

Maybe that’s what depression looks like?\n\nOr maybe that’s just ignorance, but whatever that was, her words stung like a bit*h. It really did and it made me feel terrible for days.

        "description": "To give you the best answer we must first differentiate between a clinical depression and what is thought of as depression.\n\nA clinical Depression is a depressive episode that lasts for at least 2 weeks and shows 7 of the following 9 signs (taken from the DSM-5):\n\nFatigue or lack of energy\nGuild or feelings of worthlessness\nLack of concentration/indeciseveness\nExcessive sleeping or insomnia\nAnhedonia → markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities\nRestlessness or feeling slow\nHaving thoughts of suicide or death on a regular basis\nSignificant weight change (5% in either direction)\nIf any of these signs appear every day, or almost every day, we are talking about a major depression in which case the first, and most important step is to SEEK HELP FROM A PROFESSIONAL!\n\nThere is always someone willing to listen and help. You must find someone that knows how to deal with this and that can help you. A major Depression is very serious and you need to find some kind of help. 20% of all pople suffering from major depression develop real psychotic disorders. So please, seek help.\n\nThat being said, a lot of us struggle with depressions and anxieties constantly throughout our lives. Currently speaking 5% of all people suffer from this depression and it is estimated that nearly 100% of all people go through at least one major depressive episode in the course of their life, most before they are even 30 years of age. (Source: Psychology Professors).\n\nAnxiety disorders as a whole affect a whole 40 million adults in the U.S. (18%) according to the National Institute of Mental health.\n\nThis shows just how serious depressions have become, and, as with all important things, if you run into this SEEK HELP!\n\nLuckily, most of the “depression” talk nowadays just involves feeling down for a longer period of time and experiencing at most a few of the above symptoms for a longer time, which shows a minor depressive episode that can be more easily tackled.\n\nKnowing the difference can be life-saving so it is important you assess how bad your situation is first!\n\nAfter that, here are some of the best tips I have learned in college, from psychotherapists, life-coaches and psychological experts:\n\nLooking at the problems objectively. A Depression in any form starts with problems showing up in great abundance. These problems are not the real problem, but the fact that we maximize or minimize the problems to something far greater/smaller than they are. A break-up becomes the worst thing in existence and loosing your house doesn’t matter.\nLooking at the problems objectively creates a real chance to solve them accurately. Make sure you only focus on the facts, not the feelings, and talk it through with a friend, removing emotions from the problems entirely at first.\nMeditation. As guru-like as this may sound, meditation is receiving a much higher role in psychotherapy and is used in a lot of different approaches to many psychological disorders, but has shown to be especially helpful in combating depression. The reason for this is the fact that meditation helps calm the thoughts, which are extraordinarily negative during depressions. Limiting those thoughts limits the negativity and you can focus more on what is actually happening rather than what you believe is happening. (The specific therapy that uses this a lot is called ACT → Acceptance and commitment Therapy)\nExercising. The most common symptom in people suffering from Depression is apathy towards life. They are not motivated to do anything and simply sit around, trying to waste time. If you are experiencing this then force yourself to do something! Anything is better than nothing, although exercise is one of the best things to do. Workout, do some physical activities, or be productive in some way. When you accomplish something you always feel better because you see that life can keep moving on!\nAccepting your situation. Most people try to deny the fact that they are depressed, hide from the negative events in the world and, simply put, run away from the truth. This denial causes them to misinterpret other events and the depression is left room to grow. Accept that there is a problem, but also accept the fact that you can change. Nothing is forever and you can do something about it. But you must believe in this first otherwise all the help in the world is not going to do anything for you.\nRealize it is only a season. Most depressive episodes are just that: episodes. Meaning that they show up… and then they go away. Sometimes, we just have a bad day. Period. There is no dwiddle-daddling around it and nothing we can really do about it. Accept the fact that this will happen to you but think of it like the changing of a season. We all have to go through a winter too, but eventually spring and summer will appear!\nFocus on what you can do. There are millions and millions of things that you cannot change. There are so many things that you wish you could do but can’t that focusing on it all the time is bound to make you depressed. Instead, focus on the actual things you can affect and change. You can do so much but you must focus on what you can do. The 3 most powerful words I have learned to do this are: “Okay… what now?” Given the situation, given everything that is going on, what are you going to do about it now?\nGet help. I know I have said this 3 times already but it is just that important. You are strong… stronger than you think you are, but that does not mean you have to do this alone. We are all allowed to be weak at times. No one has to carry the entire world on just their own shoulders and no one should. Getting help, even from a therapist, is nothing to be ashamed of. Everyone suffers from depression at some point so everyone needs the help. Knowing where you are weak is a sign of strength and you should get all the help you can. I mean… are you really so proud you would bet your own life on it?\n",

        "description": "Hello. We discussed this very question last month when a boy commited suicide live on Facebook. He actually admitted to the whole world that he was about to end his life as he had not been able to get over his addictions. Long story short he was in depression which led a lot of radio stations and media to question the reason for depression and anxiety amongst the youth. The main reasons spoken about by experts were -\n\nThe youth today lives in a world of editing and comparison. If my picture or check-in isn’t better than my friends then my life has no meaning. Their identity depends upon likes and reactions. I remember a joke that cropped up on FB a years ago, it said - “Nobody looks as good as their FB page and as bad as their Passport”. Sadly in the need for potraying how much fun I am and how well connected I am, the youth loses the confidence to be themselves.\nThe need for love, attachment and belonging are basic needs for all of us. This needs an actual physical connect and not just virtual talks. A lot of young people are bonding with older adults on virtual media with the aim of securing love and companionship as they may not be able to create lasting bonds with their parents (some really feel that once kids grow up they dont need talking to or sharing) & their friends arent well equipped to offer a shoulder as they are equally confused.\nDepression results not only from loneliness but from the feeling of not being good enough and not having enough people in our lives that care. That is exactly what the youth of today is facing thanks to the social media. I remember a student of mine going into depression at 24 because her entire timeline was filled with her friends getting married or into excellent jobs while she was still looking for both. Such is the pressure on the youth today.\nSo yes social media does expose the youth to as many people as they want to share and talk to but it does not give them people who are available offline, at 3 am to hold their hands and understand their insecurities, make them realise that they are worthy of love and a good life despite not having a smashing timeline or being traditionally beautiful or intelligent.",

        "description": "I think they can help fuel depression. Consider the fact that some people are more susceptible to depression than others. This could be because they have a medical condition like bipolar disorder or they are very sensitive. Incidents that happen on a social network involving friends could help trigger depression.\n\nOne must take into account that there may be a number of things contributing to say someone's circumstance-related depression. Take, for example, the person who has been struggling to find meaningful friendships. A number of incidents off-line may have been wearing this person down to the point where he is feeling a sense of lingering loneliness and times of light depression. Then bang! An incident that happens in a social network acts as the straw that breaks the camels back and depression finally overtakes him. It's not a stretch of the imagination, is it? However, the social networking incident was only the very tip of the iceberg.\n\nI've heard of some professionals telling their patients to get off facebook. I can understand why. For example, close friends that we love may become distant and cold. Every time we see their image in our facebook account or see the new photos or status they've posted may be reminder of a friendship that ended in a disappointing way. For some, that can be unpleasant.",

        "description": "This answer will upend your outlook on life.\n\nIf you always like to procrastinate, to play mobile phones in bed at night and do not want to close your eyes, to focus on doing things in only tree mins, and to occasionally want to keep working hard but cannot preserved for a week, don't be afraid—you are not really lazy, but you have not found a way.\n\nToday's method is here, you are lucky to get this answer. I help you find a self-discipline method that suits you, like playing mobile phones or playing games together to easily achieve self-discipline.\n\nI am the beneficiary of this method. Okay, let’s begin the topic.\n\n1. First understand what is true self-discipline\n\nIf you think getting up at 6 am and go to the library, then reading books till lunch, taking a snap and continue studying till 10 pm——reading books all the time except sleeping from Monday to Saturday——-is so-called self-disciplined, then you may think in a wrong way.\n\n\nThis is not called discipline, but it’s just the same as the production of production lines, a kind of process.\n\nThis kind of life is unbearable, boring. So most people will give up after a period of time, which is not universal.\n\nSo, what is true self-discipline?\n\nFirst, you have to understand what you want.\n\nThe reason why some people's self-discipline is false is because they have no clear goals, and they have made many plans for themselves. They merely think that working hard is human nature, or they will be depraved. Then they believe they are leading a good life after hard working for a period of time, but feel depraved again after few days dew to their lack of preservation.\n\nSo, you have to set a goal for yourself. Let desire and motivation drive you, not anxiety and self-blame,\n\nWhen it is your dream to wake you up every day instead of an alarm clock, you begin to understand what real self-discipline is.\n\n2. After talking about self-discipline, let's talk about how to make ourselves self-disciplined.\n\n“Harvard and MIT are just process, not a destination.”\n\n\"Life is like archery, and dreams are like arrow targets. If there is no arrow target, your bow drawing every day will be meaningless.\"\n\nHow to find your self-regulatory drive?\n\n1) First of all, we must rationally face our desires.\n\nImagining a hot guy who works out regularly, not eating fried food, and having eight abdominal muscles. Why he is discipline is because he enjoys the envy and appreciates from other people. This desire made him overcome the giving up when sweating and exhausted.\n\nA student in Harvard is studying hard everyday is because of his determination to change his fate. Studying in such university is not his destination, but changing his fate by hard studying. And this is this desire that makes him overcome his laziness and slack.\n\nTherefore, what is your desires?\n\n2) Then, face your desires directly, and then embody your desires.\n\nIt is best to be precise enough to express your desire numerically.\n\nFor example, I want to earn 1 million in 3 years and buy a house for my family. I want to lose 10 pounds in 2 months.\n\nThen, write down your specific enough desires. It can be placed on the bedside or in the mobile phone memo, as long as you can see it often.\n\n3) Subdivide the goal.\n\nFor example, if you want to earn 1 million in 3 years, so you have to save 28,000 every month. Then, consider what skills do you need to master, what job position do you need to be promoted, what do you need to do to complete these aims. Breaking your actions down into each day, you can only get it if you longing enough.\n\nThen, in the process of execution, you have to constantly remind yourself of the original plan. Because if you don’t review for a week, it ’s easy to forget your goals. Don't be overconfident to your brain. Remind yourself repeatedly so that you can finally reap the fruits.\n\nThen, as I said at the beginning, neither don’t make the plan too mechanical, nor to be a perfectionism. When problems arise, resolve them calmly and patiently. Don’t blame yourself, just continue working.\n\nGuys who can read here are excellent people who are willing to think deeply. I would like to ask you to do a favor. If the content is inspiring for you, you can spend 1 second to upvote and continue reading.\n\n3. Some self-discipline methods that make you as relaxed as playing a mobile phone\n\nUse \"method replacement\" to help you like a self-regulated life.\n\nI used to have to face the computer all the time because of my work, and my body was much weaker, so I wanted to exercise and exercise.\n\nI chose to run outdoors at first, but I gave up after a few days. Because running is a sport without too many surprises, it is boring and dull. But at that time I still attributed the reason to my involuntary discipline.",

        "description": "Discipline, the term itself is very interesting, there are a lot of people all around the world struggling for this(including me).\n\nThere is a lot of research going on in this field that how we should become disciplined in our life, what is the science behind discipline and how should we instill it in ourselves.\n\nWill power is considered to be a limited resource for a day, it’s like our mobile battery which gets charged every night.\n\nWill power as the psychologists consider it today is like a muscle, it gets weaken if you use if extensively, but since it is a muscle it can be developed and made stronger.\n\nSome of the points below can increase our discipline levels.\n\nMeditation: This is #1 thing we can do to to instill discipline in ourselves.We do not need heavy training in meditation, just start with deep breathing for five minutes a day, and this can significantly densify the grey areas in our brain responsible for providing us the willpower(self discipline) needed for the day.\nExercise: Exercising is also very important for forming the new neural connections in our brain which improve our brain functioning and our discipline.\nSurroundings: You cannot become disciplined if your environment promotes indiscipline, for e.g if you are thinking about dieting and filling you refrigerator with all those unhealthy foods it won’t work, you will not be able to resist these foods. So remove the things from yours surrounding which make you indiscipline.\nPeople around you: This is also a part of yours surroundings, if you befriend people who are lazy and very undisciplined,even you will end up being one. Surround yourself with high achievers and you will eventually achieve high. This doesn’t mean that you should leave your friendship with your lazy friends, but you should just spend more time with the high achievers.\nEating what is correct: If you eat very heavy food than that will surely disturb your day’s routine and you will not be able to follow your rituals. So keep you food light.\nSleep: As suggested earlier will power is like a battery which gets charged every night so one need to have a sound sleep so that our willpower battery remains charged by the time we get up.\nThese were the things to increase the discipline at our mental level. For having a disciplined life we can do following things.\n\nGet up early everyday, be sure you are not sleeping more than 8 hours a day at any cost, because more than that is not rest it’s laziness.\nBe the master of your gadgets not a slave of them, use them for your benefit don’t let them destroy your time.\nTurn off notifications from apps(like whatsapp, facebook or other such apps) which consume your time.\nWatch less television, or eliminate it totally, watch it only if it is adding up to your productivity.\nFor entertainment you can listen music or read books, they are as entertaining as television.\nTry to form groups for difficult things, for example if you want to do yoga everyday and you are not able to do it, then you can form a group of people who have the same goal and practice yoga with them.\nMake yourself accountable, own your mistakes and correct them in future.\nThe above points will help you live a disciplined life and also increase your efficiency in work.\n\nAt last don’t be harsh on yourself, be compassionate to yourself, because humans have tendency to make mistakes, but we also have the power to correct them in the future.",

        "title": "Elements necessary to achieve discipline",
        "description": "1) Grit / Passion / Drive\nThe higher grit or passion you have, the higher natural discipline to pursue your goals. Even if you occasionally step aside from the right track, you will eventually get back to what you set yourself to do, because it is important to you. The levels of grit / passion are very often derived from your childhood (were you rich & spoiled or had to work hard for everything?) and the way your parents explained life to you. Later on you get influenced by your friends, student mates and colleagues.\n\n2) Talent / complacency\nPeople with higher talent sooner or later realize that they can accomplish solidly with smaller time investment. Gradually they push the limits of complacency further (e.g. Spending time with hobbies / games instead of learning for the exam). They feel a \"bad concsious\" afterwards and get very productive later on as result. Do they still succeed? Usually yes, unless they get too complacent / lazy. Is this disciplined? No. One needs to watch himself so that this does not become a problem.\n\n3) Ambition / Joy\nIf you were always disciplined or set yourself higher goals on the first place, you could likely achieve more. Looking back at point 2, if you had more challenging goal, you would have likely started working on it earlier. How challenging goal you have is determined by point 1, how passionate or gritty you are about the thing.\n\nWould having higher goals and working very disciplined towards them make you happy though? Being always too disciplined would be boring and could lead to unhappy life. Being not enough discipline will lead to fail and as a result unhappiness, too. You need to find a good balance that works for you.\n\n4) Self-regulation\nOnce you figure out points 1-3 and what you eventually want in life, the self-regulation part is rather easy, because it will go naturally with your personal values. Best way how to live (seemingly) disciplined life is to pursue your passion / wants / grit, as the high passion leads to higher natural discipline. That's why \"seemingly\" as at that point you don't really live disciplined life but a natural happy life, despite the hard work.\n\nOn the pragmatic side of things, it helps to write down your goals and set yourself a deadline for every item. Use a pen and sheet of paper. Write down everything. You will see that you'll accomplish a lot and it feels good by ticking it done on your list, doesn't it?",

        "title": "My tips to achieve self discipline",
        "description": "It really isn’t that complicated. It’s about knowing where to start.\n\nA few tips I’ve been practicing for the past few years are these:\n\nSelf-discipline tip #1. Get smarter about maximizing your daily dose of willpower.\n\nWhen we wake up, it’s not uncommon that we’re overwhelmed with the amount of things we need to do, so we end up procrastinating and postponing our tasks. That’s a critical mistake, because we all have a finite amount of willpower that takes us through the day. If you want to focus on priorities, work on them early.\n\nComplete one task that you’ve been putting off all week before lunchtime. It’s going to take much less time than if you leave if for the evening.\nWrite up a weekly plan for the school or work week ahead of time. That way you won’t panic when a deadline is approaching.\nFinish homework that you’ve been putting off because you’ve been watching YouTube videos. You won’t need to stay up all night making up for lost time.\nSelf-discipline tip #2. Take care of your basic needs first.\n\nBefore you embark on your path toward any type of achievement, it’s important to cover the basics. According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, that means meeting the first level of physiological needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. Here is the first opportunity where you can practice self-discipline.\n\nEat the right food. Eat not just to be full, but also to stay healthy and maintain your brain’s optimal performance.\nGet sufficient exercise. Physical exercise is critical to performing well in every area of your life, so make sure to make it is a daily habit.\nGet enough sleep. When you’re sleep-deprived, you’ll never be able to function at optimal levels, either physically and mentally. Be sure to get enough sleep.\nSelf-discipline tip #3. Make a new habit stick by keeping it simple.\n\nEvery habit we’d like to acquire needs self-discipline, time, and repetition. If you’re reading this, chances are you feel that it’s time to make some kind of improvement in the way you do your work. To simplify a change you’re trying to make, start with tiny steps.\n\nStart with a micro task. It can be writing down a to-do list of what you need to accomplish in one day.\nDon’t multitask. Go down your list of tasks and look at each one individually. Don’t try to do a few things in the same hour.\nDivide your time into manageable chunks. Use the Pomodoro techniqueto maximize time and keep yourself on track.\nSelf-discipline tip #4. Practice saying no more often.\n\nIf you frequently find yourself running out of time to do what you need to do, it probably means you’re wasting time and energy on things that are not that important in the long run. Start building up your “no muscle” in small ways each day.\n\nWhen you’re in the middle of finishing up a project and a friend calls to talk, it doesn’t mean you should drop everything and do it. It’s okay to politely say no, ask to call them later, and stay focused on your goal.\nWhen you are working and your mobile phone lights up with a notification of a Facebook or Instagram update, don’t look at it. Keep your phone away from you when you’re working, and check it after you’ve completed a task.\nSelf-discipline tip #5. Make a specific commitment to yourself.\n\nCommitments aren’t just promises you make to other people. You can — and should — make them first to yourself. A great way to begin is to define a very specific goal you want to achieve in a certain time frame. Here are a few examples of what you can commit to. Write it down in your journal, or write it on a large sheet of paper and hang it on your bedroom wall so you see it each day.\n\nI am committed to focusing on my studies in the next 30 days so that I can pass all three of my exams with top marks.\nI am committed to completing my to-do list for today before I turn on the TV so that I don’t have to add more things to my work agenda tomorrow.\nI am committed to keeping my goals so that I can make progress in my work or school and be proud of what I’ve done.",

        "title": "Ultimate guide to self-control and discipline",
        "description": "In a society that lives and breathes instant gratification, developing self discipline is both the most worthwhile and most difficult task that you can undertake.\n\nI know this from personal experience…\n\nFive years ago, I was a lazy, depressed, alcoholic who worked a job that he hated, regularly watched porn and played video games to excess and had 0 confidence and self worth.\n\nToday, after cultivating serious self discipline, I own a high performance coaching company on track for 7-figures, have built a body that I am incredibly proud of, have an incredible girlfriend, and live a life of abundance and joy everyday.\n\nBut it wasn’t easy.\n\nIt required massive discipline to make this transformation.\n\nLuckily, along the way, I found a simple formula for achieving massive levels of discipline fast!\n\nHere it is\n\nI. It All Start with “Why”\n\nWhen I went from playing video games and watching porn for hours a day to doing nothing but hustling on my business, I didn’t do it because it felt good or because it was easy… I did it because I had no choice.\n\nI was living on my brother’s couch, making every purchase on a credit card, and scared that I would end up on the streets.\n\nI had a compelling “Why” that helped me develop the discipline necessary to achieve my dreams.\n\nThis is an extreme example but it illustrates the point.\n\nBefore you set out to develop discipline, you must have clear and concise reason for developing discipline.\n\nWHY do you want to be disciplined?\n\nDo you want financial freedom?\nDo you want to have an abundant dating life\nDo you want the body of your dreams?\nWhy is discipline a MUST for you?\n\nOnce you have your “Why” in mind, I want you to write it out and then dive into details about the feelings and results that you will have once you have developed this discipline.\n\nFor example…\n\n“I must develop discipline so that I can enjoy an abundant financial life that allows me to travel the world, spoil my girlfriend, retire my parents, and live a high quality of life”\n\nI also recommend creating a vision board, visualizing and meditating on your vision every day, and reading your “why” aloud..\n\nBut this is putting the cart ahead of the horse because all of these things require… You guessed it! Discipline.\n\nOnce you have your “Why” written down, here are a few more actionable ways to develop discipline.\n\n2. Understanding Your Brain and Optimizing Your Feedback Loop\n\nThe biggest mistake most people make when they try to become more disciplined is that they bite off too much at once.\n\nThey think they can go from lazy to Navy SEAL overnight… You can’t and you will end up doing more harm than good if you even try.\n\nInstead, you need to understand your brain and take things at an appropriate pace.\n\nHere’s how.\n\nPick ONE habit (and only one) that you are going to stick with. E.g. exercise, no processed food, meditation etc.\nNow, setup a trigger for that habit. So for example, if you decided to start exercising, put your shoes by your doorway as a reminder to exercise in the morning\nNow make the new habit or discipline SUPER easy… I mean so fucking easy it’s not even funny. So running with the workout example, commit to doing ONE pushup.. That’s it. Put your shoes on, go to your dedicated workout spot and do one pushup… Congrats, you have now exercised. The key here is that you are doing something and developing discipline\nKeep going. When you commit to ONLY doing one pushup, you are tricking your brain … If you don’t feel like working out you will think to yourself “Hell, it’s one pushup I can do that!” then you will do your pushup and think “Hmmm, I should go for 5, then 10, then 20” and before you know it you have done a whole workout.\nRinse and repeat for 21–45 days\nI recommend that you use the above formula with 6–12 new habits per year.\n\nThis might not seem like a lot, but if you apply this formula (and you if you are creative you CAN apply this formula to anything) you will achieve each of those habits and discipline yourself to actually follow through instead of failing when you try and change 20 things at once.\n\nImagine, in 12 months, with this formula you could…\n\nStart and stick to an exercise routine, packing on pounds of muscle or shredding fat\nEliminate junk food doubling your energy and results at the gym\nSave 15% of everything you earn eliminating financial stress and concern\nWake up at 5 a.m. have time for yourself and arrive at work on time every day\nStart a meditation practice and reduce your stress and anxiety\nStart a side hustle and generate $1,000-$5,000/month in residual income\nTake daily cold showers increasing your grit, resilience, and testosterone levels\nStart a daily gratitude practice that increases your happiness and fulfillment\nEliminate any addiction\nLearn a new instrument or sport\nBecome more productive and focused at work\nStart dating high quality members of the opposite (or same.. whatever floats your boat) sex",

And further they can show us the improvement they make on the point that was appreciated. Or come up with some more reasons to be appreciated. This develops a habit of looking at the good things in others and you can see a change in them in some days that they will also start appreciating you as a parent, as a person and as friend.\nSee that whether your child is more into activities (try to do things of his own), listening music /talking/sharing stories a lot or Is high on watching Movies /Reading comics.

        "description": "A2A.\n\nWe humans tend to long for what we don’t have. Those who live in villages long for city life, while those living in cities plan getaways to enjoy village life. Similarly, based on lifetime experiences, everyone has their own, unique set of desires.\n\nIs there a relationship between love and discipline? Yes and No.\n\nSee, love isn’t an emotion in itself, even though it guides all sort of emotions in us. Think of love as a motivation in this case - which motivates a person to do things that they wouldn’t normally do, and even find joy and satisfaction in it.\n\nNow, “Discipline” - if you are talking about the BDSM’s Discipline, well it’s just that one of the two partners either want to dominate or want to be dominated. Other partner, inclined to satisfy that wish/desire participates in it as well. Is it love? Yes! But only if it gives one of the two partners the happiness and satisfaction. The other partner finds comfort in knowing that their act made their partner happy.\n\nIf you are talking about “discipline” in general sense, well that again depends on partner. For someone whose partner likes to keep things organised and isn’t a fan of chaos, his or her partner would organise his/her methods (that you can call as discipline) in order to keep their partner happy. But again, Love acts just as motivation here.\n\nFor two people who neither want to be dominated or to dominate other or fan of order, discipline wouldn’t matter at all.",

        "description": "Yes. I post about my relationships online. I post photos of my partners online, when they are okay with that. I speak about my relationships at conferences and workshops. I tell stories about my sex life in front of an audience at Bawdy Storytelling. I have written two books about my relationships.\n\nWhy?\n\nSeveral reasons.\n\nFirst, I think that shame about sex and relationships is harmful. I think many people are afraid or embarrassed by things they feel and do that are common, healthy, and ordinary. I think that fear and shame causes a lot of damage.\n\nSecond, I believe authenticity, vulnerability, and openness are absolutely vital to a healthy relationship, and I believe that by modeling vulnerability and openness, I can help show people that it's okay.\n\nThird, I believe that abusive relationships are incredibly, incredibly common. I believe that many people who are being abused do not know they are being abused. I believe that abuse thrives in dark corners and hidden places. When we talk openly about relationships, and especially about what healthy relationships look like, we shine light into those dark corners and let people who don't know they are being abused see what is happening. (When Eve and I published our book More Than Two, something happened that we would never have imagined. People started writing to us and coming up to us at book events saying “thank you so much for writing that book. It helped me to see that my relationship was not healthy and I was being mistreated. That let me end the relationship, and now my romantic life is healthier.”)\n\nFinally, there is still a huge amount of bigotry about non-traditional relationships. By being open about my relationships, I help to dispel some of that prejudice and help to normalize non-traditional romantic choices. That helps other people who are in non-traditional relationships but can't be open about it because of fear of discrimination.",

        "description": "Like you, I keep my relationship off social 99% of the time. So I can only speculate as to why people share about their significant other so much. Here are a few ideas:\n\nThey want people to know they're in a relationship. Maybe they're proud to have found somebody.\nThey are so so in love with this other person that they can't help but shout it out to the world.\nThey think that sharing on social means that they really care more than people who don't share.\nThey are the type of person who shares everything so the relationship pics just happen to be part of that.\nThey want to make single people jealous.\nThey don't feel comfortable sharing anything else about themselves or their interests alone.\nThe list can go on and on.

        "title": "Best relationship advice in my opinion",
        "description": "Have you ever asked yourself, “What is the fundamental reason of seeking a relationship? “ Because if you do not have any kind of relationship in life, you become depressed. So, that means the reason you are seeking relationship is to be happy and joyful! In other words you are trying to use others as a source of your happiness..\n\nSo, when you try to use others for your source of happiness that means Your Happiness is Not on Self-Start.\n\nSo, the advice I am going to share with you is by Jaggi Vasudev. Commonly known as Sadhguru; he is an Indian yogi, mystic and New York Times bestselling author.\n\n“Lets say you bought a car in 40s. Along with car you need to get two servants beacause in the morning you need to push start. If you bought a car in 50s, one servant would do since it was crank start. Now-a-days, all the automobiles are self-start. But our happiness is still on push start. Somebody has to push it a little bit otherwise it won’t get started. “\n\n\nWhat happens when you self-start your happiness?\nIf you are happy by your own nature, then relationships become a means for one to express one's happiness and not to seek happiness. If you are forming relationships to seek happiness and trying to squeeze happiness out of somebody and that person is trying to squeeze happiness out of you. Now, this is going to be a painful relationship after sometime.\n\nIf you have become a joy by yourself and you are forming relationships because you want to express your happiness, nobody is gonna complain about you. Because you are the process of expressing your joy and not seeking joy from the other person.\n\nThus, if your life becomes an expression of your joy not in pursuit of happiness then relationships will be naturally wonderful.\n\n\nOne can hold a million relationships and still hold them good. The whole circus of trying to fulfil some other person’s expectations does not arise. Because if you are an expression of joy, anyway they want to be with you. If you are trying to extract joy from them, then they are going to avoid you. Shifting your life from persuit of happiness to an expression of joyfulness is what need to happen and then relationships really work on all levels.",

        "description": "I've been in many physically and mentally abusive relationships my whole life from the relationships with my parents to boyfriends. Let's start the amazing hell I call my life the last couple years…. ( Shortened because nobody has time for that)\n\nFATHER- left when I was very young and was in and out of my life due to the fact I was too much like my mother for him to be able to stand which led to emotional abusive things being said to me because he knew it would bother me which would make me lash out on my mom for making me that way and leading my father to find that imperfection in me.\n\nMOTHER- thoughout my whole life I was physically and mentally abused. From being hit by metal belts till there was red welts to being pulled around the house by my hair… to being pointed out that I was bigger because I got it from my father and how I was just like my father so I would never be enough for her because all she saw was my father every time she looked at me.\n\nFIRST LOVE S.L.M.- we met in the 7th grade in math class my first day at the new school. He was writing me notes and putting them in my backpack and I'd find them as soon as I opened my bag for my next class. He would write me cute things that at seemed to brighten my day and he was the first person at the new school to actually notice me… then he wasn't in class for the next two weeks I was confused…. He came back and I asked where he was and he told me he spent two weeks in juvi for charges he got before I moved…. Me being 7th grade me loving “ bad boys “ I had to have him. And I did after awhile. We became close to the point his parents and siblings were like my own. I was happy till the first time we got into a fight and he hit me. Little did I know this was only the beginning of a long abusive relationship. Many punches were thrown, threats were made and names were called in this relationship and at the end it was just time to walk away. No woman should ever be treated like that.\n\nMY SECOND RELATIONSHIP W.J.F.B.-\n\n• part 1- 2013 I started talking to a boy I went to middle School with and of course he was the school badass…. Of course I had to have him because I knew I couldn't…. We started dating over Facebook while I lived an hour away. I ended up running away with him for a few days and worried the people who cared for me sick. I thought nobody would care if I took of with a boy but there were posters with our faces everywhere… then I came home and we adventually stopped talking for almost 3 years….\n\n• part 2- I'm now 16 at this point. We started talking again. My mom started being very abusive again and I was in a hard place in my life dealing with a cocaine problem ( we will get to later) and out of a heartbreak from the guy we will talk about next. I ended up moving in with his friend and a month later getting our own place together. Then started the relationship that ruined alot. He had a previous drug problem but now only smoked marijuana and got to the point when he couldn't smoke he became mean and verbally and physically abusive…. From grabbing me, pulling my hair, punching me, screaming in my face and calling me names to the swing me around. I then was afraid to leave because he had threatened my life and his own if I did. Adventually I said Enough was enough after being homeless, having a drug problem and loosing my family and everything I ever loved or had in life and being beat on and screamed at for years….\n\nMY NEXT RELATIONSHIP D.B.H- This one wasn't too terrible I guess u could say… He treated me like a queen and got me anything I wanted but only to cover up that he was cheating on me and lying to me our whole relationship….\n\nMY LAST “ RELATIONSHIP ( not really dating) Q.A-\n\nWe talked for quite awhile on and off he was my best friend I could talk to him about anything but he was drunk most of the time or high…. We became close. He got me hooked on cocaine and it was a struggle to stop. But he was unhealthy. He was toxic. So I refused to ever be with him. Then he did something I could never forgive…. I got clean and started talking to an amazing man ( My current) and he had the nerve to talk about him and his son and I refused to ever talk to him again…. I'll never speak to him again but for that.\n\nMY CURRENT-\n\nI live with him and his amazing family who treats me like I'm part it. I fall asleep every night next to a man who loves me for everything that I am and everything that I'm not because we both have imperfections… he treats me like his queen and makes sure I feel loved and cared for every day. He's there for me no matter what I'm going through. He's a goof ball and makes me smile every day. Hes my best friend. He's the one I can always count on. I honestly love this man with all of my heart. It's like every time my heart beats it for him and his amazing little boy even though my heart skips one every time he looks me in the eyes and tells me he loves me. Like every breath is for him even when he takes it away with random kisses. He's all I've ever wanted and more than I could ever ask for. He's such an amazing man. I'm so happy I met him. I don't know what I'd do without his crazy butt in my life….. this man is literally my whole world. Nobody else matters but him and his son. I don't care about anything else but those two. I love those to sooooooooooo much more that they could ever imagine. I appreciate everything my man does for me and I couldn't thank him for everything he does. He's truly the man who stole my heart and I love it because I wouldn't have gave it to anyone else if I had the choice. He's my baby. He made me realize what love really is and how a woman should be treated. I know at times he doesn't understand why I flinch when he moves a certain way just due to my past of abuse or why I build up my walls so high or why I get hurt over certain stupid things it's just my past but he excepts it and works with me through it and makes sure I know he will never do that to me and how much I mean to him…. He's my definition of perfect because everyone has their own vision of perfect. You just have to stop trying to find it and let it find you.\n\nMy experience with relationships are terrible but I found one who is unlike any other and he's my king and I'm his queen and I couldn't be happier. Find what makes you happy.",

        "description": "Read. Some people say they hate to read. That's 100% their own fault. There are so many books out there on so many different subjects. Read something or substance. Not twitter or FB or People magazine but actual books that took people time and effort and knowledge to write.\nFind something you're willing to work hard for. For the sake of argument we'll just title this “passion”. Literally just start with something. You watched Wolf of Wall Street and want to be an investment banker, start learning finance. You think hacking looks cool in movies and love reading news on it, start learning how to hack. Weed out what you don't want to do when things get tough versus what you would keep doing. Once you find that one thing, create a short, medium and long term plan. Things can change, but having some type of plan is necessary.\nMeet people. This is so broad but just like finding “passion”, just start. Any way you can. I knew a guy who was starting learning to code, but was not in school. He started going to any club, meet-up, conventions whenever he could. He would go up to people and ask specific questions that might lead to a conversation and then possibly a relationship. It's a skill. Work at it. Do what I call effective discussion. It's essentially where you are talking to someone with a specific purpose in mind. Like getting a girls number, asking a sales associate for a lower price, or trying to get a reference on your resume.\nTo do list. Every night before bed, create a to-do list fon the next day. Finish all those things. You either want it or you don't. Those that want it will finish the to-do list. Just try not to swamp yourself with unnecessary tasks. Start with the most important and work your way down.\nTake challenges head on. Self positive talk. Stop viewing things as obstacles and more as opportunities. This just comes with experience and getting out of your comfort zone one small step at a time.\nBaby steps. You can't change overnight so don't try. Read ten pages every day; accomplish your to-do list; learn something new every day and write it down at night; try to talk to one new person every day.\n\nNo one is born thinking, I'll be an expert at that. So don't worry about getting it all together in a weeks worth of time. Take it slow, find a subject your passionate at, and work at it a little bit every day.",

        "description": "Right after you pass out tenth standard, you should have a clear idea or at least have an idea as to what your strengths and weaknesses are. I know it's difficult to assess at that age. But to be more successful it's important to know what exactly you want at that age. It will pave the way to build a strong Base for your career.\n\nI agree it's the duty of the schools to let know the child as to what he or she can become with the amount of inclination at that particular age. But sadly our schools are unable to do that. And even parents are unable to guide their children, despite their so called education.\n\nCareer counselling as a profession is not that sought after in a country like India. But with the Advent of Internet it has become easy for all of us to get exposed to a new world where a fifteen year old child is able to float a company and a sixty year old is motivated enough to take uphill tasks in his life.\n\nTips to be successful in ones career:\n\nHardwork will take you places. Have you ever heard about a person who got killed by hardwork?\nAcquiring specialist skills is important so that you can get recognised.\nDont be afraid to travel a lot if your job demands. By travelling a person learns a lot. So, Its better to learn at company's cost.\nTake time to read a lot about leadership, management skills, people skills. After a point of time, you no longer remain a trainee engineer (example), you will grow to lead a group of people.\nIs time management necessary to be successful? Yes, of course if you don't manage your time, you will be on the losing side.\nFailing to plan is Planning to fail. If you don't plan the things you will falter.\nHaving goals is important, otherwise you will end up with a life full of unfulfilled wishes.\nTake time to appreciate people around you. Especially the people who are less privileged, after some time you will notice that good things coming back to you.\nTalk less and listen more, you got two ears and one mouth. By this habit whenever you speak you will be respected a lot.\nTry to take calculated risks in life do not get into comfort zone a dedicated stagnate at one point. Be flexible with your choices.\nTry to learn a foreign language, this will certainly help you at some point or the other.\nIt doesn't matter who you are what you do, it's always good to stay humble.\nSave for the rainy day,one fine day when you get a pink slip due to any reason, your savings will help you.\nAs you grow try to remove the unwanted things from your mind, I mean you should be more clear about your objectives as you age.\nThere is no harm in running that extra mile.\nAlong the way you will find many unwanted elements who will try to pull you down, you just do your work and don't get entangled in the things which don't concern you.\nCommuting takes a lot of time, choose a mode of transportation which will take lesser time and if it takes a loner duration, you can utilise this time by listening to audio pep talks which will boost you to achieve your goals. Don't try to listen to these talks when you are driving your own vehicle.\nSome points may seem to be insignificant, but I felt these are the generalised points which can make your journey smooth.",

        "description": "I spent a lot of time as a young man trying to understand relationships. It was a learning process. I learnt somethings and I still learn.\nIt took me years. Hope this helps you I am blessed to share\n\n1. Be Honest with yourself first and know yourself : Why do you need the relationship? whats your goal for the relationship is it companionship or sex or partnership or sharing love? why do you want to commit? what are your intentions and motivations? Why did your last relationship fail? Are you using relationship to curb your loneliness or medicate your feelings? Work on your issues they are yours. Changing relationships will not make you less of an alcoholic or addict. stop the blame and be straight with yourself.\n\n2. Learn to love , respect yourself and have your happiness generated internally : Do not have a relationship or marriage just because you think the relationship will make you happy. If you not happy on your own a relationship will not change that.\n\n3. Observe the Parents of your dating partner or to be spouse : Many times not always though we pick up our traits from our parents and their conditioning. We can change that but we will in some or many ways be like our parents. DO NOT IGNORE THIS ! see if you can live with those behaviors or challenge them early in the dating.\n\n4. Be Vulnerable and use I statements: If you feel mad at something your partner did.Make sure you tell them how you feel if it persists and be direct honest and make sure you use I statements.\n\n5. Understand and Learn to Forgive: There is nothing wrong in feeling mad. But if we truly love our partner and care about the relationship we will learn to listen and understand. And forgive the ones we love , that does not mean we take abuse. It means we understand they human like us. I\n\n6. Learn to Listen and solve conflicts : We need to not just hear but listen to each other where they are coming from , what it means to them etc. Its getting their world of perception. Its resolving conflicts as adults. you do not have to be perfect realize you both human. STAY PRESENT to his or her emotions, feelings and expectations NOT Just the words they saying.\n\n7. Learn your partners love language: We all receive love and give love in different ways some by gifts. Learn you and your partners love language.\nThere are five primary ways in which partners give and receive love.\nGifts , words of appreciation, physical touch, acts of service and quality time.\nThe five love languages - Gary Chapman is a good book to start.\n\n8. Learn to take responsibility and accountability : Do not just say sorry actually meant it and say you were wrong and speak from the vulnerable place. Make sure you learn from it and take accountability for what you did. Show that you learnt from it.\n\n9 . Remember the law of learning and growing : Two people who choose to be together will obviously be different in many ways have different parents etc. We mostly get angry cause something within us gets triggered. If i get angry fast maybe, its time to learn to be more patient. NEVER BLAME see what you can learn and if you troubled by something your partner did use Step 4. Always LOOK INSIDE FIRST ask why did this trigger me.\n\n10. Make your relationship central not your personal EGO's : If you really value the relationship and genuinely care for the other person its an easy choice. Remember love is a choice and action. You need to recommit to it over and over and be present to why you chose that person and chose to consciously love them. LEARN to LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY if you can. In conflicts remember to both ask the question whats good for our relationship ?\n\n11. Make sure you are aligned and not try to change your partner but accept them : Make sure you both choosing to grow spiritually,mentally and emotionally. Make sure you both at similar stages of growth in that aspect. DO NOT HOPE your partner will change or ignore something in the chemical high of the romantic phase or initial hormones. ACCEPT THEM THE WAY they are if they grow good.\n\n\n12. Try to Stay present: Stay present and in the moment let yesterday and day before be bygones.if its a repeated behavior use step 4.\n\nLastly remember the chemicals will die and romantic love phase will end after first two years. After that its a conscious choice which you work on ,as you consciously choose to make it better. You can choose to make sex better. You can choose to love.\n\nWill there be times your partner annoys you yes.Will you feel like leaving ? maybe that's the time to contemplate on why you chose this person and recommit your love. Your choice to love will be tested its in those moments of conflict and argument that there is opportunity to learn, love and grow.\n\nIN THE END We all humanly doing the best we can with what we know and our experiences in the big picture and hindsight its good to always remember that when dealing with our partner and families.",

In such a situation, you should find a chance to play with players who are playing at a higher level than you and players who are playing better than you. Or consult a coach related to that game.\n\nSometimes players perform very well. But, they are not able to keep it. After 4 hours, 10 hours of practice in the field, we are unable to perform as needed. In that situation, do not be disappointed at all, have faith in yourself. Do not think about people at all. Keep the mind calm. And just focus on your game.\n\nFORMULA OF SUCCESS IN SPORTS\n\nYou have to make a habit in your life. Watch the best performing videos on YouTube related to your game 1 to 2 hours before sleeping at night. And it has to be seen every day. Gradually you will start seeing good changes in your game.\n\nIf you are a football player, then watch videos of football well-performed game. If you play kabaddi, watch the video of kabaddis good performance. And if you bowler in cricket, then watch some videos of good bowling performance, if you are a batsman then watch videos of good batting.\n\nThe purpose behind this, when you do this. So you train your mind. Now understand it carefully, Something like this happens in the game. you have to take action within a few milliseconds. It is far to think.\n\nTo handle this situation, the brain has to be trained through these videos. Because within milliseconds your brain cannot think. According to the picture you have shown to your brain through the video, the brain automatically takes action without thinking.\n\nThe second reason, why are you have to watch videos of good performed games ( related to your sports) before going to sleep at night?
